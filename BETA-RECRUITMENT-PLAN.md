# The Hub - Beta Recruitment Plan

## Goal: 10-20 Active Beta Testers in 1 Week

**Target Start:** [Launch Date - 7 days]  
**Target End:** [Launch Date]  
**Success Criteria:** 15+ accepted testers, 10+ active after Week 1

---

## Recruitment Philosophy

**Quality > Quantity**
We want collectors and deal hunters who will *actually use* The Hub, not people who sign up for everything and ghost.

**Authentic > Salesy**
Our messaging should sound like a friend sharing something cool, not a corporate ad campaign.

**Community-First**
We're recruiting people who want to be part of building something, not just beta testing software.

## Channel 1: Direct Outreach (Warmest Leads)

### Target Audience
- Friends and family who collect/flip
- Existing newsletter subscribers
- People who've asked about The Hub
- Discord/Telegram community members

### Strategy: Personal DMs

**Timing:** Day 1 (immediate)  
**Method:** Direct message, email, or text  
**Volume:** 10-15 personal messages

**Why This Works:**
- High trust, low friction
- These people already know you
- More likely to give honest feedback
- Will champion the product later

### Outreach List Segmentation

**Tier 1: Inner Circle (5-7 people)**
- Friends who collect watches, sneakers, etc.
- Family members who flip items
- Your most engaged newsletter subscribers

**Tier 2: Community Members (5-8 people)**
- Active Discord/Telegram members
- People who've replied to your content before
- Previous customers/users of other products

### Message Template (Personalized)

See `beta-outreach/dm-template-personal.md` for full template.

**Key Elements:**
- Personal greeting (use their name, reference past conversation)
- Brief context on what The Hub is
- Why *they* specifically would be perfect
- Clear ask: "Would you be interested in beta testing?"
- No pressure exit: "Totally cool if not!"

---

## Channel 2: Twitter/X Strategy

### Audience Research

**Target Accounts:**
- Watch collectors: @watchfred, @hodinkee followers
- Sneaker community: @soleretriever, @snkr_twitr
- Car enthusiasts: @bringatrailer followers
- Deal hunters: @slickdeals community

### Hashtag Strategy

**Primary Hashtags (use 2-3 per tweet):**
- #watches #watchfam #watchcollector
- #sneakerhead #sneakers #kicks
- #bringatrailer #carsofinstagram #petrolhead
- #deals #dealoftheday #sidehustle

**Avoid:**
- Generic #beta #startup (attracts wrong crowd)
- Over-hashtagging (looks spammy)

### Tweet Drafts (5-10 Tweets)

See `beta-outreach/twitter-drafts.md` for full drafts.

**Tweet Types:**
1. **Problem-focused:** "Ever missed a grail watch because you didn't check r/WatchExchange at the right time?"
2. **Storytelling:** "I missed a $2k Rolex because I was asleep when it posted..."
3. **Teaser:** "Building something for watch collectors who are tired of refreshing marketplaces..."
4. **Social proof:** "Just helped a sneakerhead save 40 hours/month..."
5. **Direct ask:** "Looking for 10 watch/sneaker collectors to beta test..."

### Posting Schedule

**Week 1:**
- Day 1: Problem-focused tweet (morning, 8-9 AM)
- Day 2: Engage with replies, retweet with addition
- Day 3: Storytelling tweet (evening, 6-7 PM)
- Day 5: Direct ask tweet (mid-day, 12-1 PM)
- Day 7: Social proof / update tweet

**Best Times to Post:**
- Weekday mornings: 8-10 AM (people browsing during coffee)
- Weekday evenings: 6-8 PM (after work scroll)
- Weekend afternoons: 2-4 PM (leisure browsing)

### Engagement Strategy

**Proactive:**
- Reply to tweets from collectors sharing finds
- Quote-tweet cool deals with "This is why I built The Hub..."
- Join conversations in #watchfam threads

**Reactive:**
- Respond to all replies within 2 hours
- DM interested people with beta link
- Thank people for RTs/engagement

---

## Channel 3: Reddit Strategy

### Target Subreddits

**Tier 1 (Best Fit):**
- r/Watches (600k+ members) - watch collectors
- r/Sneakers (4M+ members) - sneaker enthusiasts
- r/WatchExchange (200k+) - buying/selling watches
- r/Flipping (100k+) - resellers and flippers
- r/SneakerMarket - sneaker trading

**Tier 2 (Secondary):**
- r/Watchhorology
- r/frugalmalefashion (deal hunters)
- r/bringatrailer (car enthusiasts)
- r/PersonalFinanceCanada (side hustlers)

### Subreddit Rules Review

**Before Posting:**
- [ ] Read rules for self-promotion
- [ ] Check if "beta testing" posts allowed
- [ ] Look at post history (what gets upvoted?)
- [ ] Note best days/times to post

**Red Flags:**
- "No self-promotion" = Don't post, engage organically
- "Mod approval required" = Message mods first
- "No surveys/requests" = Skip this one

### Reddit Post Strategy

**Approach: Value-First, Not Salesy**

**Option A: The Storytelling Post**
- Share your journey building The Hub
- Vulnerable, honest about the problem
- Soft ask at the end for beta testers
- Focus on community contribution, not selling

**Option B: The Question Post**
- "How do you currently track deals in [niche]?"
- Engage in comments genuinely
- Mention beta in comments if people ask

**Option C: The "I Built This" Post**
- Show screenshots/demo
- Explain the problem you're solving
- Invite feedback and beta testers
- Respond to EVERY comment

See `beta-outreach/reddit-templates.md` for full post drafts.

### Timing & Engagement

**Best Times to Post on Reddit:**
- **Monday-Thursday:** 6-8 AM EST (catches morning commute + early workers)
- **Tuesday/Wednesday:** Best engagement days
- **Avoid:** Friday PM, weekends (unless niche is hobby-focused)

**Engagement Rules:**
- Respond to every comment within first 2 hours
- Be helpful, not defensive
- Upvote thoughtful replies
- Award helpful feedback (if budget allows)

**What to Avoid:**
- Copy-pasting same post across multiple subs (looks spammy)
- Deleting and reposting (against rules)
- Arguing with criticism (gracefully accept feedback)
- DMing people without permission (creepy)

## Channel 4: Product Hunt Ship (Pre-Launch Page)

### Setup

**Product Hunt Ship Page:**

- Offer early beta access to subscribers
- Share updates during beta

**Benefits:**

### Content Strategy

**Ship Page Elements:**

## Application Screening Process

### Beta Application Form

**Questions to Ask:**
1. What do you collect or flip? (watches, sneakers, cars, etc.)
2. How often do you check marketplaces for deals? (daily, weekly, etc.)
3. Have you ever missed a deal due to timing? Tell us about it.
4. What device will you test on? (iOS, Android, desktop)
5. Can you commit to 2-4 weeks of testing?
6. Twitter/Reddit handle (optional, for context)

### Screening Criteria

**Auto-Accept:**
- Active collector with specific niche (watches, sneakers)
- Checks marketplaces daily
- Personal story about missed deals
- Has device compatibility

**Waitlist:**
- Interested but vague answers
- Unsure about commitment
- Edge-case use case

**Reject:**
- Not actually a collector/flipper
- Just wants free stuff
- Can't commit to testing
- No device compatibility

### Response Template

**Accepted:**
> "Welcome to The Hub beta! We're excited to have you. You'll receive your welcome email within 24 hours with setup instructions. In the meantime, join our beta community: [Discord link]"

**Waitlisted:**
> "Thanks for applying! We're at capacity for this first batch, but we'd love to have you in the next wave. We'll email you in 1-2 weeks. In the meantime, you can follow along: [Twitter/Ship link]"

**Rejected (Soft):**

## Messaging Guidelines

### Voice & Tone

**Be:**
- 🗣️ **Conversational** - Like talking to a friend, not a customer
- 🎯 **Specific** - Mention watches, sneakers, actual use cases
- 😊 **Enthusiastic** - You're excited about this!
- 🤝 **Collaborative** - "Help us build" not "Test our product"

**Avoid:**
- 🚫 Corporate speak - "Leverage synergies"
- 🚫 Hype - "Revolutionary AI-powered game-changer"
- 🚫 Desperation - "Please please sign up"
- 🚫 Vagueness - "A tool for deal finding"

### Example Good vs. Bad

**❌ Bad:**
> "We're launching a revolutionary platform that leverages cutting-edge technology to optimize your deal discovery workflow. Sign up for exclusive beta access!"

**✅ Good:**
> "I built The Hub because I kept missing grail watches on r/WatchExchange while I was asleep. If you're tired of refreshing marketplaces, I'd love your feedback on the beta."

## Tracking & Optimization

### Metrics to Track

**Application Funnel:**
- Views → Applications → Accepted → Active Testers
- Track by channel (Twitter, Reddit, direct, etc.)

**Channel Performance:**
- Which channel had highest quality testers?
- Where did most engaged users come from?
- Cost per tester (time invested)

**Messaging Performance:**
- Which tweets got most engagement?
- Which Reddit posts converted best?
- What DM response rate?

### Week 1 Review

**Questions to Ask:**
- Did we hit 10-20 active testers?
- Which channel over/under-performed?
- What messaging resonated most?
- Where should we double down?

**Adjust:**
- If under target: Post in more subreddits, increase Twitter frequency
- If over target: Pause recruitment, create waitlist
- If wrong quality: Tighten screening criteria

---

## Contingency Plans

### If We're Under 10 Testers by Day 7

**Emergency Tactics:**
1. Post in additional subreddits (r/frugalmalefashion, r/sidehustle)
2. Run small Twitter/Reddit ads ($20-50 budget)
3. Reach out to micro-influencers in niche communities
4. Extend deadline by 3-5 days
5. Lower barrier (reduce commitment ask)

### If We Get 50+ Applications

**Overflow Strategy:**
1. Accept top 20 by quality
2. Create Tier 2 waitlist (10 people)
3. Notify waitlist they'll be invited Week 2
4. Use surplus interest for Product Hunt launch

### If Quality is Low (Too Many Tire-Kickers)

**Quality Control:**
1. Add phone/video interview step
2. Require referral from existing tester
3. Ask for LinkedIn/Twitter to verify legitimacy
4. Tighten screening questions
