This suggests that the seller may be willing to part with it, potentially due to:\n\n1. **High resale value**: As I mentioned earlier, the Snowflake has a strong following among watch collectors and enthusiasts.\n2. **Condition and provenance**: The watch's condition, originality, and any associated documentation or provenance could impact its value.\n\nOverall, this deal seems like an exceptional opportunity for anyone looking to acquire a high-quality, rare, and historically significant watch at a discounted price. I'd say it's worth considering, especially if you're familiar with the market demand and can appreciate the watch's technical merits.\n\nHow about we keep an eye on this one?",
