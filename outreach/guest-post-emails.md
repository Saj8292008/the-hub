# Guest Post Outreach Email Templates

## Template 1: Data-Driven Approach

### Subject Line Variations
1. "Data from 50,000 [watch/sneaker/car] listings — pitch for your readers"
2. "I analyzed [niche] market trends — article idea for [Site Name]"
3. "Original research: What [target audience] are buying in 2026"
4. "[Site Name] readers would love this data story"
5. "Unique dataset + article pitch for [Site Name]"

### Email Body

Hi [Editor Name],

I've been tracking [watch/sneaker/car] listings across multiple marketplaces for the past year — over 50,000 data points. The patterns are fascinating, and I think your readers would find them valuable.

I'd love to contribute a guest post to [Site Name] based on this research. Here are three angles I could take:

1. **"[Niche] Buyers Are Making This Mistake (According to the Data)"** — behavioral insights from marketplace activity
2. **"The [X] Most Undervalued [Items] Right Now"** — price analysis revealing hidden gems
3. **"When to Buy: Timing Patterns in the [Niche] Market"** — seasonal and weekly trends

I run The Hub (thehubdeals.com), a deal aggregator, so I have ongoing access to fresh data. Previous articles: [link to 2-3 relevant blog posts].

Would any of these topics work for your editorial calendar?

Best,  
[Your Name]

## Template 2: Expert Insight / Problem-Solution

### Subject Line Variations
1. "How I solved [common pain point] — guest post idea"
2. "Your readers ask about [problem] — I have answers"
3. "Tool announcement: [Brief description] (article pitch)"
4. "Solving [pain point] for [target audience] — pitch for [Site Name]"
5. "Guest post: The smarter way to [achieve goal]"

### Email Body

Hi [Editor Name],

Every [watch collector/sneakerhead/car enthusiast] I talk to struggles with the same problem: tracking deals across multiple sites is exhausting.

I built a solution and documented the journey. I think [Site Name] readers would appreciate both the how-to and the tool itself.

Potential articles:

1. **"I Built a Deal Tracker to Stop Missing [Niche] Opportunities"** — technical how-to with lessons learned
2. **"The 5-Minute Morning Routine for Serious Deal Hunters"** — practical workflow guide
3. **"Why Manual Deal Hunting Is Dead (And What to Do Instead)"** — industry perspective piece

My background: I run The Hub Deals and have experience with [relevant credibility]. Writing samples: [links].

Would this be a fit? Happy to adjust the angle to match what resonates with your audience.

Thanks,  
[Your Name]

## Template 3: Tool Announcement / Community Value

### Subject Line Variations
1. "Free tool for your readers: [Brief description]"
2. "I made something for [target audience] — want to share it?"
3. "Resource announcement: [Tool name] for [Site Name] community"
4. "Your readers need this — guest post + free tool"
5. "Giving away [tool] — article pitch for [Site Name]"

### Email Body

Hi [Editor Name],

I built a free tool that [watch collectors/sneaker enthusiasts/car shoppers] actually use: The Hub Deals aggregates listings from [X] marketplaces into one searchable feed.

Rather than just announce it, I'd like to write something genuinely useful for [Site Name] readers:

1. **"The Ultimate Multi-Marketplace Shopping Guide"** — how to maximize coverage + avoid scams
2. **"I Interviewed 50 [Niche] Collectors About Their Deal Strategies"** — community insights
3. **"Building vs. Buying: When to Use Tools vs. Manual Search"** — honest pros/cons analysis

The Hub gets a one-line mention as context, not a sales pitch. Focus stays on practical value for your audience.

Examples of my writing: [links to blog posts]

Interest in any of these? I can also tailor something specific to your content mix.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

### Email Body

Thanks for considering it,  
[Your Name]

## Pro Tips for All Templates

### Do:
- **Research the editor's name** — "Hi [First Name]" beats "Dear Sir/Madam" every time
- **Reference recent articles** — "I loved your piece on [topic]" shows you read the site
- **Keep it scannable** — Short paragraphs, bullet points, clear structure
- **Offer options** — 3 title ideas lets them pick what fits
- **Make it easy to say yes** — "I can have a draft in 5 days" removes friction

### Don't:
- **Don't oversell yourself** — Let the ideas speak for themselves
- **Don't send attachments** — Links to writing samples only
- **Don't follow up more than once** — Two emails total, then move on
- **Don't pitch competitors simultaneously** — One site at a time per niche
- **Don't forget to proofread** — Typos = instant rejection

## Tracking Template

Keep a simple spreadsheet to track outreach:

| Site Name | Editor | Date Sent | Template Used | Response | Status | Follow-Up Date |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Worn & Wound | [Name] | 2026-02-15 | Data-Driven | - | Pending | 2026-02-20 |
| Nice Kicks | [Name] | 2026-02-15 | Expert Insight | Yes | Writing | - |

This prevents duplicate outreach and helps you track conversion rates per template.
