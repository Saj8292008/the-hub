## 💡 Outreach Strategy

**Option A: Direct Reply (Helpful)**
Reply to WTB posts with: "I built a deal tracker that monitors r/watchexchange, Chrono24, and WatchUSeek. Set an alert for [specific watch] and you'll get notified when one posts. Free: [link]"

**Option B: DM First**
DM buyers with: "Saw you're looking for [watch]. I built a tool that tracks deals across Reddit + Chrono24. Want me to set up an alert for you?"

**Option C: Provide Value First**
Find an actual listing that matches their request, reply with the link, THEN mention: "BTW I built a tool that does this automatically if you want alerts for future listings"

## ⚠️ Rules to Follow

1. **Must comment before DMing** (sub rule)
2. **Don't spam** - pick 3-5 best targets per day
3. **Be genuinely helpful** - find them deals, don't just pitch
4. **Build karma first** - engage in other threads too
