## Target Customer Profile

### Primary Segments

| Segment | Description | Pain Points | Value Prop |
|---------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| **Power Resellers** | 10+ sales/month, multi-platform | Time copying listings, inventory tracking, double-sells | Automation, sync, efficiency |
| **Growing Resellers** | 3-10 sales/month, wants to scale | Manual processes limiting growth | Scale without more work |
| **Collectors Selling** | Enthusiasts offloading pieces | Don't want to become spreadsheet experts | Simplicity, set it and forget it |
| **Small Dealers** | Semi-pro, Instagram + local | No real system, losing track | Professional tools at indie price |

### Ideal Customer Signals
- ✅ Posts on 2+ platforms (Reddit + eBay, IG + Grailed, etc.)
- ✅ Has "Verified/Trusted Seller" status
- ✅ Posts multiple items per week
- ✅ Complains about platforms in comments ("eBay fees suck")
- ✅ Asks about inventory management tools
- ✅ Multiple sizes/variants = bulk operator

### Red Flags (Low Priority)
- ❌ Only sells occasionally (garage cleanout)
- ❌ Only uses one platform religiously
- ❌ Massive operation (>$100k/month) - need enterprise solution
- ❌ Only trades, doesn't sell

## Where to Find Them

### Reddit (Highest Quality)

**r/Watchexchange** (~300k members)
- Best sellers have feedback flair (50+, 100+ transactions)
- Sort by Top/Month to find active power sellers
- Check r/WatchExchangeFeedback for transaction histories
- [WTS] + [SOLD] flair = successful seller

**r/sneakermarket** (~227k members)
- Seller flairs: 🌟 (100+), 💰 (10+), ✅ (5+)
- Check r/SneakerMarketRefs for verified sellers
- Multiple size posts = bulk operations

**Prospecting Method:**
1. Open subreddit, sort by New or Top/Week
2. Click on sellers with good flair/history
3. Check their post history - multi-platform = good target
4. Add to prospects list with notes
5. DM personalized message

### Instagram (Volume)

**Hashtag Hunting:**
- #watchforsale #preownedwatches #luxurywatchesofinstagram
- #kicksforsale #sneakerforsale #sneakerreseller

**Profile Signals:**
- "DM for prices" in bio
- Link to personal site (not just eBay)
- Posts 2-3x per week
- Shows receipts/authenticity
- 1k-50k followers (sweet spot)

### Discord (High Intent)

**Servers to Join:**

- Brand-specific servers (Rolex, Jordan, Yeezy)
- Reseller/cook group communities

**Finding Sellers:**
- #for-sale or #wts channels

### Other Channels

## Outreach Strategy

### The 3-Touch Approach

**Touch 1: Warm Up (Optional but powerful)**
- Engage with their content first
- Like posts, reply to story, comment genuinely
- Creates familiarity before the pitch

**Touch 2: Initial Outreach**
- Send personalized DM referencing specific content
- Focus on THEIR pain, not your features
- Ask for feedback, not a sale
- No links in first message

**Touch 3: Follow Up**
- If no response after 4-5 days, one polite bump
- Add new value (article, tip, feature they'd like)
- If still nothing, move on

### Channel-Specific Tactics

| Platform | Approach | Timing | Key Tip |
|----------|----------|--------|---------|
| Reddit DM | Reference specific listing | Afternoon | Check they have DMs open |
| Instagram | Reply to story first | Evening | Use voice DM to stand out |
| Discord | Be active in server first | After chatting publicly | Don't mass DM |
| Email | Very personalized | Tue-Thu morning | 5 sentences max |

## Message Framework

### The SPIN Formula

1. **Situation**: Reference their current state
   - "Saw you sell on Reddit and eBay..."

2. **Problem**: Name a pain they likely have
   - "Managing listings across platforms is a pain..."

3. **Implication**: What it costs them
   - "Probably losing time or had a double-sell..."

4. **Need**: Your solution
   - "Built The Hub to solve exactly this..."

### Key Phrases That Work

**Opening:**
- "Quick question about your [watch/sneaker] business..."
- "Saw your [SPECIFIC ITEM] post - gorgeous piece"
- "Noticed you're one of the top sellers on..."

**Problem:**
- "Do you ever get tired of..."
- "How do you currently handle..."
- "Curious if you've dealt with..."

**Ask:**
- "Would love your feedback on..."
- "Would you be interested in checking it out?"
- "Can I show you what we've built?"

**Close:**
- "No pressure either way"
- "Even if not interested, would love your thoughts"
- "Early access is free - just want feedback"

## Objection Handling

### "I'm good with spreadsheets"
"Totally get it - spreadsheets work! The Hub is basically spreadsheets on autopilot. You enter once, it syncs everywhere. Would it save you time if you didn't have to manually update 5 platforms when something sells?"

### "I don't have time"
"That's exactly why I built this - to save time. 5 minutes to try it could save you hours per week. Worth a quick look?"

### "I only sell on [one platform]"
"Makes sense to focus. If you ever expand, we'll be here. Mind if I check back in a few months?"

### "What does it cost?"
"For beta testers, it's free while we're building. Just looking for feedback from real sellers like you."

### "How do I know it's legit?"
"Fair question. Here's my [Reddit profile / sales history / etc]. Happy to hop on a call so you can ask questions."

### "I've tried other tools"
"What didn't work for you? Genuinely curious - helps me build something better. The Hub does [specific differentiator]."

## Follow-Up Cadence

```
Day 0: Initial outreach
Day 4-5: Follow up if no response
Day 14: Final "closing the loop" message
Day 30+: Circle back with new feature/update (optional)
```

### Follow-Up Templates

**First Follow-Up (Day 4-5):**
"Hey, just bumping this in case it got buried. No worries if not interested - just let me know either way 👍"

**Final Follow-Up (Day 14):**
"Last one from me! If you're ever curious about The Hub, the offer stands. Good luck with your sales 🙌"

**Re-Engagement (Day 30+):**
"Hey [name], we added [new feature] to The Hub - thought of you. Still happy to show you if interested."

## Tracking & Metrics

### Use tracker.json

Every contact should be logged with:
- Platform & segment
- Date of first/last contact
- Current status
- Notes on conversation
- Follow-up date if needed

### KPIs to Track

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Response Rate | 20-30% | If lower, refine messaging |
| Interest Rate | 10-15% | Of those who respond |
| Conversion Rate | 5-10% | Of those interested |
| Messages/Day | 5-10 | Quality > quantity |

### Weekly Review
- How many contacted?
- Response rate by platform?
- What messaging worked?
- Any patterns in rejections?

## Community Best Practices

### DO ✅
- Be a genuine community member first
- Reference specific content/items
- Offer value before asking
- Accept "no" gracefully
- Build reputation over time
- Share useful tips/content

### DON'T ❌
- Mass-blast identical messages
- Pitch in public comments
- Lie about what The Hub does
- Badmouth competitors
- Contact same person repeatedly
- Violate subreddit/server rules

### Reputation is Everything

These are small communities. Word travels fast.

- One good experience = referrals
- One bad experience = blacklisted
- Be helpful even to non-customers
- Share wins publicly (with permission)
- If someone has a bad experience, fix it publicly
