## DM Template for Instagram

"Hey [name]! Love your content, especially [specific recent post].

I built thehubdeals — finds underpriced watches and sneakers before they sell.

Would love to give you free lifetime access + affiliate cut if you want to share with your audience. No pressure either way 🤝"

## Notes
- DM in morning (8-10am) or evening (7-9pm) for best response
- Like/comment on 2-3 of their posts first
- Keep it SHORT - IG DMs get skimmed
- Follow up once after 5-7 days if no response
