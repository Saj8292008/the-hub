## r/Watches (320k members)

**Title:** Built a free tool that monitors Reddit + Chrono24 for watch deals

**Body:**
Hey r/watches! I've been hunting for deals on my grail for months and got tired of refreshing multiple sites. So I built something.

**The Hub** monitors:
- r/watchexchange posts in real-time
- Chrono24 price drops
- WatchUSeek marketplace

It scores deals based on price vs market value and sends alerts when something good pops up.

Features:
- Price history tracking
- Target price alerts (set your max, get notified)
- Weekly digest email with top deals

It's free to use. Would love feedback from the community.

## r/WatchExchange (180k members)

**Title:** [META] Made a deal tracker that monitors this sub + other marketplaces

**Body:**
Mods, let me know if this isn't allowed and I'll delete.

I built a tool called The Hub that aggregates watch listings from here, Chrono24, and WatchUSeek. It:

- Pulls new r/watchexchange posts automatically
- Scores deals based on pricing data
- Sends Telegram/email alerts for hot deals
- Tracks price history

Figured it might be useful for buyers trying to catch deals quickly. Free to use, no ads.

Feedback welcome!

## r/Sneakers (2.3M members)

**Title:** Built a free price tracker for StockX/GOAT - alerts when your size hits target

**Body:**
Got tired of checking StockX every day waiting for prices to drop. Built a dashboard that does it for me.

**The Hub** tracks:
- StockX prices by size
- GOAT listings
- Price history over time

Set a target price, get a Telegram notification when it hits.

Also tracks watches and cars if you're into that.

Free tier available. Feedback appreciated 🙏

## r/Flipping (400k members)

**Title:** Free deal aggregator for watches, sneakers, cars - scores deals automatically

**Body:**
Built this for my own flipping and figured others might find it useful.

**The Hub** scrapes:
- Reddit marketplaces (watchexchange, sneakermarket)
- StockX, GOAT, Chrono24
- Various forums

It automatically scores deals based on:
- Price vs recent sales
- Listing age
- Seller history (where available)

Best deals surface to the top. Get alerts via Telegram or email.

Free to use. Looking for feedback on what sources to add next.
