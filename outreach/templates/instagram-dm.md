# Instagram DM Templates

## Template A: Compliment + Value

Hey! Love your page - that [SPECIFIC ITEM] you just posted is 🔥

Quick question: how do you manage your inventory across platforms? I built something called The Hub for watch/sneaker resellers - basically one dashboard to list everywhere, track sales, and sync inventory automatically.

Would you be down to check it out? I think it'd save you a ton of time. No charge for early users - just want feedback from real resellers like you.

## Template B: Story Reply Opener

**Step 1:** Reply to their story genuinely
**Step 2:** After they respond, pivot:

"Btw I noticed you sell [watches/sneakers] - do you list on multiple platforms? I'm building a tool to manage that and looking for beta testers. Would love your feedback if you have 5 mins 🙏"

---

## Template C: Direct Ask

Hey [handle]! Saw you sell [watches/sneakers] and you've got great stuff.

I built The Hub for resellers like you:
✓ List to eBay, Grailed, Chrono24 in one click
✓ Auto-sync inventory (no double sells)
✓ Track what's selling and at what margins

Early access is free - just looking for feedback. Interested?

## Template D: Voice Message Script

If they seem casual/friendly, voice DMs can stand out:

"Hey [name], hope this isn't weird but I love your page. I'm building this tool for sneaker resellers to manage their inventory and I'm looking for people to test it out. Figured you'd be perfect for it. Anyway, let me know if you're interested - would love to show you. Thanks!"

(Keep under 30 seconds, sound natural not scripted)

## Instagram DM Best Practices

1. **Engage first** - Like 2-3 posts, maybe comment, before DMing
2. **Reply to stories** - Highest open rates, feels natural
3. **No links first message** - Builds trust, avoids spam filters
4. **Use emojis but don't overdo** - Match their energy
5. **Be brief** - They're scrolling, not reading essays
6. **Follow up once** - If no response after 3-5 days, one polite bump
7. **Time it right** - Evening/night when people are browsing
8. **Don't pitch in comments** - Always take to DMs
