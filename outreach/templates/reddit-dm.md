## Template A: Fellow Enthusiast Approach (Watches)

**Subject:** Quick question about your watch business

Hey [username]! 👋

I've seen your posts on r/Watchexchange - you've got some beautiful pieces and clearly know what you're doing. That [SPECIFIC WATCH FROM THEIR RECENT POST] was gorgeous.

Quick question: how do you currently keep track of your inventory and sales? I ask because I'm building something called **The Hub** - a tool specifically for watch/sneaker resellers to manage their stuff across platforms.

Basically: one place to list everywhere, track what's sold, manage pricing. No more spreadsheets or copy-pasting listings to eBay/Chrono24/Instagram.

Would love to show you if you're interested - or even just get your thoughts on what would actually be useful. You're exactly the kind of seller I want to build this for.

No pressure either way - keep posting great pieces! 🙌

## Template B: Problem-Focused Approach (Sneakers)

**Subject:** For your sneaker business

Hey [username],

Saw you're an active seller on r/sneakermarket (congrats on the [SELLER FLAIR] status btw).

Real talk - do you ever get tired of:
- Posting the same pair to Reddit, eBay, Grailed, etc?
- Tracking what's sold where in spreadsheets?
- Updating prices across 5 different platforms?

I'm building The Hub to solve exactly this. One dashboard, list everywhere at once, automatic inventory sync.

If that sounds useful, I'd love to show you what we've got. Or if you think it's dumb, I'd genuinely love to hear why - helps me build something people actually want.

Either way, keep killing it! 🔥

## Tips for Reddit DMs

1. **Reference a specific listing** - shows you're not mass-spamming
2. **Keep it short** - Reddit users hate walls of text in DMs
3. **No links in first message** - can trigger spam filters
4. **Ask for feedback** - positions you as wanting help, not selling
5. **Send from account with karma** - brand new accounts get ignored
6. **Respect if they say no** - small community, reputation matters
