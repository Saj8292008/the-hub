# Discord DM Templates

## Finding Prospects on Discord

**Servers to join:**
- Watch trading servers (search Discord server lists)
- Sneaker cook groups / resell communities
- r/Watchexchange and r/sneakermarket Discord servers
- Brand-specific groups (Rolex, Jordan, Yeezy communities)

**How to find sellers:**
- Look in #for-sale or #wts channels
- Note frequent posters with multiple listings
- Check who has "Verified Seller" roles
- Active in #price-check channels = knows the market

## Template A: Server Member Approach

Hey [username]! 👋

I've seen you posting in [server name] - you always have solid pieces. 

Quick question: do you sell across multiple platforms (eBay, Reddit, etc)? I'm building a tool called The Hub specifically for resellers to manage inventory and cross-post listings.

Would love to show you if you're interested - or even just get your thoughts on what would actually help. Looking for feedback from experienced sellers like you.

No pressure! Just thought I'd reach out 🤙

## Template B: After Interacting in Server

(After chatting with them in a public channel about a listing/topic)

"Hey, following up from our chat in [server]. You clearly know your stuff with [watches/sneakers].

Random ask - I'm building a reseller tool and looking for beta testers. Basically one place to manage inventory and post to all platforms. Would you be interested in checking it out? Early users get free access."

## Template C: Cook Group / Resell Community

"Yo, been in [group name] for a bit and saw you're active in the resell game.

I made this tool called The Hub for managing inventory across platforms - eBay, StockX, Grailed, etc. One listing, posts everywhere, tracks what's sold.

Looking for experienced resellers to test it out (free obviously). Down to take a look?"

## Discord Best Practices

1. **Be active in servers first** - Don't join and immediately DM
2. **Establish presence** - Help people, answer questions, be known
3. **Check if DMs are open** - Some users block server DMs
4. **No mass DMs** - Discord bans for spam quickly
5. **Mutual server reference** - "Saw you in [server]" builds trust
6. **Don't poach openly** - Admins will ban you for soliciting members
7. **Offer value first** - Share useful info before asking for anything
8. **Voice chat if possible** - Higher conversion, builds real connection
