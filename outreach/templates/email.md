## Template A: Short & Personalized

**Subject:** Tool for [watches/sneakers] resellers

Hi [Name],

Found your [website/profile] and love what you're doing with [specific thing about their business].

I'm building The Hub - a tool for watch/sneaker resellers to manage inventory across platforms. One listing syncs to eBay, Chrono24, Reddit, Instagram, etc. No more copy-pasting or double-sells.

Would you be interested in a quick demo? Looking for feedback from experienced sellers.

Best,
[Your name]

## Template B: Problem-Agitate-Solution

**Subject:** Managing inventory across platforms?

Hi [Name],

Quick question: do you ever list the same piece on multiple platforms and then scramble to mark it sold everywhere when it sells? Or spend time copy-pasting listings from one site to another?

I built The Hub to solve exactly that. One dashboard where you:
- Create a listing once → post to 5+ platforms
- Mark something sold → auto-removes everywhere
- Track margins and what's actually selling

I'm looking for beta testers (free access) and thought you'd be a perfect fit based on your [inventory/store/posts].

Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick demo?

## Template C: Referral Ask

**Subject:** Know any resellers who'd find this useful?

Hi [Name],

I'm building a tool for watch/sneaker resellers to manage their business across platforms (think Shopify but for secondary market sellers).

I noticed you're [connected to the community/run a related business] - do you know any resellers who might be interested in beta testing? Happy to offer early access perks for any referrals.

Or if this is something you'd use yourself, I'd love to show you.

Thanks!
[Your name]

## Email Best Practices

1. **Subject line matters** - Keep it short, specific, not salesy
2. **5-sentence max** - Busy people skim
3. **One clear CTA** - "15 minutes for a demo?" not multiple asks
4. **Personalize first line** - Reference something specific about them
5. **Send Tuesday-Thursday** - Highest open rates
6. **Follow up once** - 3-5 days later if no response
7. **No attachments** - Triggers spam filters
8. **Professional signature** - Name, title, one link max
