## Podcast Pitch Template 1: The Data Storyteller

**Subject Line:** "Podcast guest: I have sneaker/watch/car marketplace data your listeners would love"

**Email Body:**

Hi [Host Name],

I've been binge-listening to [Podcast Name] — your episode with [recent guest] was fantastic.

I have a podcast pitch that might interest you: I run The Hub Deals, where I aggregate watch, sneaker, and car listings from dozens of marketplaces. Over the past year, I've collected data on over [X] listings, and the patterns are wild.

**Topics I could cover:**
- Why [specific niche] prices behave the way they do (with actual numbers)
- The "hidden gem" formula: Finding undervalued items before the market catches on
- Behind-the-scenes of building a deal aggregator (tech, challenges, lessons)
- Marketplace psychology: How buyers make decisions (and get manipulated)

I'm [your background/credentials], and I can keep it entertaining while being data-rich. Happy to tailor the conversation to what resonates with your audience.

Would this fit your show? I can send talking points or hop on a quick call to brainstorm angles.

Best,  
[Your Name]  
[Email] | [Phone] | [The Hub URL]

## Podcast Pitch Template 2: The Hustler / Community Angle

**Subject Line:** "Guest pitch: Deal hunting, market arbitrage, and niche aggregators"

**Email Body:**

Hey [Host Name],

Long-time listener here — [Podcast Name] has been in my rotation for months. Your conversation with [guest] about [topic] was killer.

I think your audience would dig this: I built The Hub Deals to solve a problem every collector faces — how do you monitor 10+ marketplaces without losing your mind?

**What we could talk about:**
- The "deal hunting as a side hustle" playbook (finding, flipping, scaling)
- Niche aggregation: Why focusing on watches/sneakers/cars worked (and what I'd do differently)
- Tools and workflows: What actually helps vs. what wastes time
- Real stories: The craziest deals I've found, the scams I've avoided, the lessons I've learned

I'm not selling anything — just want to share what I've learned in the trenches. Plus, I've got funny war stories from the deal-hunting world.

Let me know if this fits! Happy to adjust the angle or send a longer pitch.

Cheers,  
[Your Name]  
[Email] | [Phone] | [The Hub URL]
