# Outreach Templates

## Template 1: YouTuber DM

**Subject:** Quick tool for your viewers

Hey [Name]!

Love your content - been watching since [specific video].

I built a free tool called The Hub that tracks watch/sneaker prices across Reddit, Chrono24, StockX, etc. It alerts you when prices drop below your target.

Thought it might be useful for your audience who's hunting deals.

Would you be open to checking it out? Happy to set you up with an affiliate link if you want to share it - you'd earn on signups.

No pressure either way - keep making great content!

## Template 2: Newsletter Swap

**Subject:** Newsletter cross-promo idea

Hey [Name],

I run The Hub newsletter - we cover deals on watches and sneakers (price drops, market trends, etc).

We're at [X] subscribers and growing. Would love to explore a cross-promo:

- We mention your newsletter to our list
- You mention us to yours

Our audiences seem aligned. Interested?

## Template 3: Blog Guest Post Pitch

**Subject:** Guest post idea: "How to Never Overpay for a Watch Again"

Hey [Editor name],

I run The Hub, a price tracking tool for watches and sneakers. 

I'd love to write a guest post for [Blog name] on:

**"X Data-Backed Strategies to Find Watch Deals"**

I'll include real examples from our price data - what days have the best deals, which brands hold value, etc. Actionable stuff, not fluff.

Would that work for your audience?

# Where to Find Contact Info

- **YouTube:** About page → Business email
- **Newsletters:** Reply to any email from them
- **Blogs:** Contact page or team page
- **Twitter/X:** DMs if open
- **Instagram:** DMs (less effective)

# Pro Tips

1. **Personalize** - mention specific content you liked
2. **Lead with value** - what's in it for them?
3. **Keep it short** - busy people skim
4. **Follow up once** - then move on
5. **Track responses** - know what works
