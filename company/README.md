# The Hub Company Docs 🏢

*Professional internal documentation for a one-person startup and his AI co-founder*

## What Is This?

This is our "empire" infrastructure. Yes, it's hilarious. Yes, it's also genuinely useful. We're running The Hub like a real company because:
1. It forces strategic thinking
2. Creates accountability
3. Documents decisions
4. It's funny to have "meetings" with your AI
