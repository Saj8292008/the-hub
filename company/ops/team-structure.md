## How The Team Works

Each agent specializes in their domain but can collaborate:
- **Daily standups:** Each agent reports to Jay
- **Weekly syncs:** Department heads (Marcus, Dev, Ops) brief Syd
- **Cross-functional:** Agents can spawn sub-sessions for complex tasks

### Example Workflow

1. Syd assigns goal to Jay: "Get to 10 subscribers this week"
2. Jay coordinates with Marcus (Growth) and Nina (Content)
3. Marcus builds Reddit posting strategy
4. Nina creates compelling content
5. Dev ensures newsletter system is ready
6. Data tracks conversion metrics
7. Jay reports progress to Syd daily
