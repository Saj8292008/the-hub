Supporting local businesses doesn't have to break the bank.

I've been using The Hub – a membership app that offers 50%+ off local restaurants, spas, and entertainment.

Here's what I've noticed:
→ I'm going out more (supporting local economy)
→ I'm spending less per outing
→ I'm discovering places I wouldn't have tried at full price

Win for me, win for local businesses getting more foot traffic.

$9.99/month. Saved $150+ last month alone.
