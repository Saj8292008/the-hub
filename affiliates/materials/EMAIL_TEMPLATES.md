## 📧 Template 1: Introduction Email

**Subject Lines (A/B test):**
- I found a way to save 50% on local restaurants
- This app is saving me hundreds on date nights
- Stop paying full price for [City] restaurants

---

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

You know how frustrating it is to see a great restaurant or spa, get excited... then check the prices and think "maybe next month"?

I've been using **The Hub** for the past few weeks, and honestly, it's changed how I do local stuff.

**Here's the deal:**

The Hub is a membership that gives you 50%+ off local restaurants, spas, entertainment, and activities. Not sketchy Groupon-style "deals" with a million restrictions – these are real discounts at places you actually want to go.

Some deals I've used recently:
- 40% off at [Local Restaurant Example]
- Buy-one-get-one spa treatments
- Half-price tickets to [Local Activity]

**It's $9.99/month** (basically one fancy coffee), and I've already saved over $200.

If you're into supporting local businesses AND saving money, this is kind of a no-brainer.

Let me know if you try it!

P.S. – They add new deals every day, so I've made it a habit to check the app before making any local plans.

## 📧 Template 2: Deal Highlight Email

**Subject Lines:**
- Today's deal: 50% off [Restaurant Type] 🍽️
- This week's best local deal (ends Sunday)
- I just saved $47 on dinner – here's how

---

**Body:**

Quick one for you—

I spotted this deal on The Hub and had to share:

🍽️ **[Restaurant Name] – 40% off any entree**
📍 [Neighborhood/Area]
⭐ 4.5 stars, 200+ reviews

I'm going this weekend. Join me? (Okay, not literally, but you know what I mean.)

**The Hub** is the app I use to find deals like this. $9.99/month, and I usually save that on my first meal.

[Check out today's deals →](AFFILIATE_LINK)

New deals drop daily, so there's always something good.

## 📧 Template 3: Comparison/Review Email

**Subject Lines:**
- Groupon vs. The Hub: Which is actually worth it?
- I tried 3 deal apps – here's the winner
- The local deals app I actually kept using

---

**Body:**

I've tried pretty much every "deals" app out there.

Groupon? Full of random stuff I don't want.
Restaurant.com? Confusing and limited.
LivingSocial? Does that still exist?

**Then I found The Hub.**

Here's why it's different:

✅ **Actually local** – Deals in your city, not random internet stuff
✅ **Real discounts** – 50%+ off, no weird restrictions
✅ **Fresh daily** – New deals every day, not the same stale offers
✅ **Simple** – Show the app, get the discount. Done.

**What I've saved this month:**
- Dinner at [Restaurant]: $32 saved
- Spa day: $45 saved  
- Movie night: $15 saved
- **Total: $92** (membership cost: $9.99)

Yeah, the math works out.

Worst case? You cancel during the trial and pay nothing. Best case? You save hundreds.

## 📧 Template 4: Seasonal/Holiday Email

**Subject Lines:**
- Valentine's Day dinner without the $$$ 💘
- Summer activities that won't break the bank
- Holiday shopping? Save on experiences instead

---

**Body:**

[Holiday/Season] is coming up, and you know what that means...

Everything gets expensive.

Restaurant reservations? $$$$
Spa appointments? $$$$
Activities? You guessed it.

**Here's my hack:**

I use **The Hub** to find deals on all the [holiday/seasonal] stuff everyone else pays full price for.

Right now they have:
- 🍽️ [Seasonal restaurant deal]
- 💆 [Seasonal spa/wellness deal]
- 🎁 [Seasonal activity deal]

The membership is $9.99/month, but I literally saved $150 on [holiday]-related stuff last year.

[👉 Get 7 days free →](AFFILIATE_LINK)

Don't pay full price for [holiday]. Your wallet will thank you.

**💡 PARTNER SPOTLIGHT**

**Save 50%+ on local restaurants, spas & activities**

I've been using The Hub to find deals around [City], and it's been a game-changer. $9.99/month, but I save 10x that easily.

New deals drop daily. Show the app, get the discount. Simple.

## 📧 Template 6: Re-engagement (For Existing Subscribers)

- Still paying full price? 👀
- Remember that deals app I mentioned?
- Quick reminder: Free trial still available

---

**Body:**

Hey [First Name],

A few weeks ago I mentioned **The Hub** – the app I use for local restaurant and activity deals.

Just checking in because:

1. They're still offering a **free 7-day trial**
2. I've saved another $[XX] since I last emailed
3. They just added [new feature/new area/new deal type]

If you haven't tried it yet, now's a good time.

[👉 Start your free trial →](AFFILIATE_LINK)

No pressure – just wanted to make sure you saw this in case the first email got buried.
