---

### Slide 1 (Hook)
**Text:** How to spot an underpriced watch in 60 seconds
**Subtext:** (Most collectors miss this)
**Design:** Dark bg, bold white text, teal accent

### Slide 2
**Text:** Step 1: Know the market price
**Body:** Before you buy ANYTHING, check what it's actually selling for.
- Chrono24 for new/used average
- WatchCharts for market trends
- eBay sold listings for real prices

**Design:** Clean, numbered step, small icons

### Slide 3
**Text:** Step 2: Check the seller
**Body:** A "great deal" from a sketchy seller isn't a deal — it's a risk.
- Look for transaction history
- Check feedback/ratings
- Reddit flair = verified trades

### Slide 4
**Text:** Step 3: Condition matters more than price
**Body:** A $500 "deal" with scratched crystal and dead movement costs $800 after repair.
- Always ask for movement shots
- Check for service history
- "Running" ≠ "serviced"

### Slide 5
**Text:** Step 4: Do the math on the flip
**Body:** If you're buying to resell:
- Subtract platform fees (eBay: 13%, StockX: 9-10%)
- Subtract shipping + insurance
- Is there still $200+ profit? THEN it's a deal.

### Slide 6
**Text:** Step 5: Speed wins
**Body:** The best deals don't last.
- Hot listings sell in < 1 hour
- By the time you see it on Reddit, someone's already DMed
- You need alerts, not scrolling

### Slide 7 (CTA — The Tool Pitch)
**Text:** Or... let AI do all of this for you.
**Body:** The Hub scans thousands of listings 24/7 and scores every deal 0-100.

Price? ✅ Checked against market
Seller? ✅ Verified
Condition? ✅ Factored in
Speed? ✅ Instant alerts

```
Most people overpay for watches because they skip these 5 steps.
