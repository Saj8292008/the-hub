## 1. Where to Promote

### Reddit Communities (Primary Channel - FREE)

**Watches:**
| Subreddit | Members | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| r/Watchexchange | 300k+ | Don't spam. Comment helpfully on WTB posts with "check @hubtest123 for deals" |
| r/Watches | 1.8M | Share interesting finds, link channel in comments naturally |
| r/WatchesCirclejerk | 200k+ | Meme-friendly, can share ridiculous deals with humor |
| r/RepTime | 500k+ | Rep community loves deal alerts |
| r/Seiko | 150k+ | Budget-focused, perfect for entry-level deal alerts |
| r/rolex | 200k+ | Higher-end, AD availability alerts |

**Sneakers:**
| Subreddit | Members | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| r/Sneakers | 3M+ | Biggest community, share deal finds as "PSA" posts |
| r/SneakerDeals | 150k+ | **PERFECT FIT** - post deals directly, mention channel |
| r/sneakermarket | 200k+ | Marketplace, comment on WTB with channel link |
| r/Repsneakers | 800k+ | Rep community, deal-hungry |
| r/FrugalMaleFashion | 2M+ | Sneaker deals do well here |
| r/Sneaker_Release_Dates | 50k+ | Share drop alerts |

**Cars:**
| Subreddit | Members | Strategy |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| r/Cartalkbids | 30k+ | BaT discussions, share undervalued finds |
| r/whatcarshouldIbuy | 800k+ | Answer questions, mention deal tracking |
| r/Flipping | 1M+ | General reseller community, share arbitrage opportunities |
| r/Askcarsales | 250k+ | Dealer insights, share market deals |
| r/cars | 5M+ | General car content |

**Reddit Posting Rules:**
- Never direct link spam - get banned instantly
- Build karma first (comment value for 1-2 weeks)
- Frame as "I found this resource" not "join my channel"
- Use "PSA:" format for deal posts
- Cross-post good deals between relevant subs

---

### Facebook Groups (HIGH POTENTIAL)

**Watches:**
- "Watch Trading Group" (50k+ members)
- "Affordable Watch Group" (30k+)
- "Seiko Collectors Club" (20k+)
- "Rolex Forum" (40k+)
- "Omega Enthusiasts" (15k+)

**Sneakers:**
- "Sneaker Marketplace" (100k+)
- "Nike/Jordan Buy Sell Trade" (200k+)

2. Be active for 1 week before any promotion
3. Share deals as "found this, thought I'd share"
4. Create story posts linking to channel
5. DM active members who post WTB requests

---

### Discord Servers (UNTAPPED)

**Watch Discords:**
- Watchuseek Discord (~5k members)
- Time+Tide Discord
- Hodinkee Discord (unofficial)
- r/Watches Discord

**Sneaker Discords:**
- Notify (paid but has free channels)
- SoleLinks Discord
- Sneaker Twitter Discord
- KicksOnFire Discord

**Car Discords:**
- Doug DeMuro Discord
- Cars & Bids Discord
- Regular Car Reviews Discord
- Hoovies Garage Discord

**Discord Strategy:**
- Join and lurk for 3-5 days
- Provide value in #general before self-promo
- Most have #promo or #links channels - USE THEM
- Offer to share exclusive deals to the server

---

### Forums (OLD SCHOOL BUT LOYAL)

**Watches:**
- **Watchuseek.com** - Largest watch forum. Sales corner has deals. Signature linking allowed.
- **Rolex Forums** - High-end, but deals appreciated
- **Omega Forums** - Brand-specific

**Sneakers:**
- **NikeTalk.com** - OG sneaker forum, still active
- **SoleSavy Community** (paid)
- **Sneaker News comments** - Comment with value

**Cars:**
- **BringaTrailer.com comments** - Active community
- **Cars&Bids comments**
- **Rennlist** (Porsche)
- **Bimmerpost** (BMW)
- **FerrariChat**

**Forum Strategy:**
- Create account with professional signature including @hubtest123
- Answer questions genuinely for 2 weeks
- Start threads sharing "best deals I found this week"
- Forums have older, higher-spending demographics

---

### Other Telegram Groups (CROSS-PROMO)

**Find these via Telegram search:**
- Search: "watch deals" "sneaker drops" "car auction"
- Look for groups (not channels) with 500-5000 members
- Avoid groups with "no promo" rules

**Cross-promo script:**
> "Hey, I run @hubtest123 - we aggregate deals on watches, sneakers, and cars. Would love to cross-promote. We'll share your group, you share our channel. DM me if interested."

**Target 10-20 smaller Telegram groups for mutual promotion.**

---

## 2. Content Strategy

### Content Pillars (What to Post)

| Content Type | Frequency | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| **Hot Deals** | 3-5x daily | "🔥 Seiko Presage $180 (normally $425) - Amazon lightning deal" |
| **Price Drops** | 2-3x daily | "📉 Jordan 4 Military Black dropped to $150 on StockX" |
| **Arbitrage Alerts** | 1x daily | "💰 Omega Seamaster selling for $3,200 in Japan, $4,100 US market" |
| **Auction Alerts** | As needed | "🏎️ E30 M3 at Cars & Bids ending in 2 hours - currently $45k" |
| **Market Intel** | 2-3x weekly | "Rolex Submariner prices dropped 8% this month - here's why" |
| **Weekend Roundup** | 1x weekly | "Top 10 deals you might have missed this week" |

### Posting Schedule

**Weekdays:**
- 7-8 AM CT: Morning deal drop (catches early risers)
- 12-1 PM CT: Lunch deals (work break scrollers)
- 6-7 PM CT: Evening deals (post-work)
- 9-10 PM CT: Late night deals (when auctions end)

**Weekends:**
- 10-11 AM: Weekend deals roundup
- 4-5 PM: Afternoon deals
- Post when auctions end (BaT ends Sunday evenings)

### What Makes People STAY Subscribed

1. **Consistent Value** - Miss a day, lose trust. Post daily minimum.
2. **Exclusive Finds** - Deals they can't find elsewhere
3. **Speed** - Be FIRST. Deal hunters are competitive.
4. **Curation** - Not every deal, the BEST deals. Don't spam.
5. **Actual Savings** - Show % off and $ saved every time

### What Makes People SHARE

1. **"Holy shit" deals** - 50%+ off triggers sharing
2. **Limited quantity urgency** - "Only 3 left"
3. **Referral incentives** - "Share with 3 friends, get exclusive alert access"
4. **Grail items** - When a sought-after item goes cheap
5. **Screenshots with context** - Easy to forward

### Post Format Template

```
🔥 [CATEGORY] DEAL ALERT

[Product Name]
💰 NOW: $XXX (was $XXX) - XX% OFF
📍 Where: [Store/Platform]
🔗 [Link]

⚡ Why it's good: [1 sentence context]

## Metrics to Track

| Metric | Week 1 Goal | Month 1 Goal |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Subscribers | 50 | 200 |
| Avg post views | 30 | 150 |
| Daily posts | 3+ | 4+ |
| Reddit karma gained | 100 | 500 |
| Cross-promo deals | 2 | 10 |

---

## Key Success Factors

1. **CONSISTENCY** - Post every single day. No exceptions.
2. **SPEED** - Be first to deals. Set up alerts on Slickdeals, Honey, CamelCamelCamel.
3. **CURATION** - Don't post every deal. Post the BEST deals.
4. **VALUE FIRST** - In every community, give before you take.
5. **PATIENCE** - Growth is slow, then fast. Trust the process.

---

## Deal Sources to Monitor

**Watches:**
- Jomashop daily deals
- Amazon watch deals
- r/watchexchange price drops
- eBay ending soon with low bids
- Chrono24 price drops

**Sneakers:**
- Nike.com restocks
- StockX price drops
- GOAT price drops
- Finish Line sales
- Footlocker releases

**Cars:**
- BringaTrailer (ending auctions)
- Cars & Bids
- eBay Motors ending soon
- Copart/IAAI for flippers
- Facebook Marketplace steals

---

## Quick Reference: Don't Do This

❌ Spam links without context  
❌ Post in communities without reading rules  
❌ Promote before providing value  
❌ Post mediocre deals (damages trust)  
❌ Ghost the channel (inconsistency kills)  
❌ Ignore engagement (reply to everything early on)  
❌ Buy fake subscribers (tanks engagement rate)  

---

## Final Note

The first 100 subscribers are the hardest. After that, word of mouth kicks in IF your content is genuinely valuable. 

Focus on finding deals so good that people HAVE to share them. That's the whole game.

Now execute. 🚀
