## Body Copy:

Good morning,

Quick question: What would you pay for a **1969 Grand Seiko Hi-Beat 36,000**?

If you said "$899," congratulations—you're either psychic or you've already seen today's listings.

Here's what crossed The Hub's radar in the last 24 hours:

🔹 **1969 Grand Seiko Hi-Beat** - $899  
   (36,000 bph. May 1969. Yes, really.)

🔹 **Omega Speedmaster 38 Co-Axial** - $399  
   (Modern Omega tech, accessible price)

🔹 **Universal Genève Altesse** - $335  
   (Vintage Swiss elegance, forgotten brand)

🔹 **Certina DS Podium Chronograph** - $255  
   (Swiss sport quartz that just works)

**148 new listings** hit our trackers yesterday. These four rose to the top.

The secondary market is HOT right now—not because prices are high, but because the deals are *insane*. Collectors are moving inventory, upgrading collections, and creating opportunities for smart buyers.

**The catch?** These won't last. Vintage Grand Seikos under $1K get scooped up fast. Same with sub-$400 Omegas.
