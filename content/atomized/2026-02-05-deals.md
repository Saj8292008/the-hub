## 🔹 TWITTER/X THREAD

Just spotted some heat on the secondhand market 🔥

A thread of the best watch deals I found this week (yes, including a stickered Rolex):
```

**Tweet 2/6:**
```
1. NEW Rolex Submariner 126613LN Two-Tone

Stickered, full kit, 2026 card

$19,900 on r/Watchexchange

The two-tone Sub is making a comeback. This one's unworn.
```

**Tweet 3/6:**
```
2. Rolex Daytona 116500LN Black Dial

2023 production, full set

$27,500

Still below retail waitlist territory. The Panda gets all the love but the black dial is timeless.
```

**Tweet 4/6:**
```
3. Glashütte Original SeaQ Pano Date

German watchmaking at its finest

$8,000

Retail is $12k+. This is serious value if you want something different from the Swiss crowd.
```

**Tweet 5/6:**
```
Budget corner 💰

• Vintage Omega Genève boxed - $600
• Bell & Ross V2-94 Full Lum LE - $2,350
• Tag Heuer F1 - $247

You don't need to spend $10k+ to wear something great.

Hey [First Name],

Here are the top deals I spotted this week:

**🏆 HEADLINERS**

**NEW Rolex Submariner 126613LN Two-Tone** — $19,900
Stickered, unworn, 2026 card. The two-tone Sub is back in style, and this one hasn't even left the store (sort of). Found on r/Watchexchange.

**Rolex Daytona 116500LN Black** — $27,500  
2023 production, full set. The black dial Daytona doesn't get as much hype as the Panda, but that means better prices for you.

**Glashütte Original SeaQ Pano Date** — $8,000
German precision at a steep discount. Retail is $12k+. If you want something different from the Swiss mafia, this is it.

**🎯 MID-RANGE PICKS**

**Bell & Ross BR V2-94 Full Lum Limited Edition** — $2,350
Full lume dial, limited production, complete set. B&R flies under the radar.

**💰 BUDGET CORNER**

- Vintage Omega Genève boxed — $600
- Tag Heuer F1 35mm — $247
- Rado Musketeer VI — $199

Proof that great watches don't require a second mortgage.
