## Quick Verdict

| Feature | The Hub | StockX |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **What it is** | Deal aggregator | Marketplace |
| **Fees** | $0 (we don't sell) | 10-13% buyer/seller fees |
| **Pricing** | Free + Premium ($9/mo) | Free to browse |
| **Authenticity** | Varies by source | StockX verified |
| **Speed** | Real-time alerts | 7-14 day delivery |
| **Best For** | Finding deals | Guaranteed authenticity |

---

## The Core Difference

**StockX** is a marketplace. You buy watches FROM StockX (they authenticate and ship).

**The Hub** is a deal finder. We show you deals ACROSS marketplaces so you can buy direct from sellers.

---

## Why This Matters: The Fee Problem

StockX charges:
- **Buyers:** ~3% transaction fee + shipping
- **Sellers:** 9-10% commission

On a $10,000 watch, you're paying $300-$400 in fees you wouldn't pay buying peer-to-peer.

**The Hub alternative:** We aggregate Reddit (r/Watchexchange), forums, and other P2P sources where:
- No platform fees
- Prices are already 10-20% lower than retail
- Negotiation is possible

---

## StockX Strengths (When It Makes Sense)

1. **Authentication guarantee** — Every watch is verified before shipping
2. **No negotiation** — Set price, simple transaction
3. **Buyer protection** — StockX handles disputes
4. **Anonymity** — You don't interact with the seller

**Use StockX if:** You're nervous about authenticity, want zero hassle, and don't mind paying a premium for convenience.

---

## The Hub Strengths (When We Win)

1. **Better prices** — P2P deals are 15-30% below StockX bids
2. **Speed** — See deals in real-time, buy immediately
3. **Variety** — We aggregate 10+ sources StockX doesn't cover
4. **No fees** — What you see is what you pay (seller price only)

**Use The Hub if:** You're comfortable with P2P buying, want the best deal, and value speed.

## Price Comparison Example

**Watch:** Rolex Submariner 116610LN

| Platform | Typical Price | Fees | Total |
|----------|---------------|------|-------|
| StockX | $11,200 | +$336 (3%) | $11,536 |
| r/Watchexchange (via The Hub) | $10,400 | $0 | $10,400 |

**Savings using The Hub:** $1,136 (9.8%)

---

## But What About Fakes?

Fair concern. Here's how to stay safe when buying P2P:

1. **Check seller history** — r/Watchexchange has feedback systems
2. **Use PayPal G&S** — Buyer protection for disputes
3. **Request references** — Legitimate sellers have transaction history
4. **Ask for verification** — Many sellers will FaceTime the watch
5. **Use an escrow service** — For high-value purchases

The Hub doesn't verify watches (we aggregate deals), but experienced buyers save thousands by buying P2P.

---

## When to Use Each

| Scenario | Use StockX | Use The Hub |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| First luxury watch purchase | ✅ | |
| Experienced collector | | ✅ |
| Need it shipped fast (US) | | ✅ (P2P is faster) |
| International shipping | ✅ | Depends |
| Negotiating price | | ✅ |
| Maximum savings | | ✅ |

---

## The Hybrid Approach

Many collectors use both:

1. **Use The Hub** to find the best current deals
2. **Compare to StockX prices** to gauge market value
3. **Buy P2P if comfortable**, or use StockX if the price gap is small

---

## Summary

StockX is a safe, convenient marketplace with premium pricing.

The Hub helps you find better deals across P2P platforms where you keep more money in your pocket.

**For new buyers:** StockX's authentication provides peace of mind.

**For experienced buyers:** The Hub's deal aggregation saves real money.
