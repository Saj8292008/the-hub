## The Chrono24 Problem: Too Much Noise

Chrono24 has everything. That's the problem.

Search "Rolex Submariner" and you get 5,000 results. Are any of them good deals? No idea. You'll spend hours comparing prices, checking seller ratings, and trying to figure out what's fair.

**The Hub solution:** We do that work for you. Our AI scores deals based on:
- Price vs. market average
- Seller reputation
- Listing quality
- How fast similar items sell

You see a curated feed of actual opportunities, not a haystack.

2. **Global reach** — Dealers and sellers worldwide
3. **Buyer protection** — Escrow service and dispute resolution
4. **Trusted Checkout** — Payment protection on qualified listings

**Use Chrono24 if:** You want maximum selection and don't mind searching manually.

---

## The Hub Strengths

3. **Speed** — Real-time alerts beat manual searching

5. **P2P included** — Reddit deals often beat dealer prices

## Price Comparison Example

**Watch:** Omega Speedmaster Professional Moonwatch

**Chrono24:**
- Range: $5,800 - $8,500
- Average listing: ~$6,500
- Time to find good deal: 30-60 minutes of searching

**The Hub:**
- Alert set: "Speedmaster under $5,500"
- Result: Notified when r/Watchexchange listing hits $5,200
- Time spent: 30 seconds to check notification

**Savings: $1,300 + 59 minutes**

---

## Aggregation Advantage

The Hub doesn't just show Chrono24 deals. We aggregate:

- r/Watchexchange (Reddit)
- r/watch_swap (Reddit)
- WatchUSeek forums
- eBay (selected)
- Chrono24 (when pricing is competitive)
- Private dealer sites

**Why this matters:** The best deals often aren't on Chrono24. Forum and Reddit sellers don't pay Chrono24's 6.5-11% commission, so prices are lower.

---

## Fees: The Hidden Cost

Chrono24 charges sellers 6.5-11% commission. Guess where that cost ends up? In the listing price.

A seller who wants $10,000 for their watch lists it at $11,000 on Chrono24 to cover fees.

On Reddit or forums, that same seller lists at $10,000. Maybe $9,500 for a quick sale.

**The Hub finds those listings** — before they're marked up for marketplace fees.

---
