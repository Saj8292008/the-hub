## What is WatchCharts?

WatchCharts is a market analytics platform for watch collectors. It tracks prices across marketplaces, shows historical trends, and helps you understand what a watch is "worth" based on recent sales.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent market data and price history
- Collection tracking with value estimates
- Research tool for understanding fair market value

**Limitations:**
- Not designed for deal hunting
- Doesn't aggregate live listings
- Won't alert you when a specific deal drops

---

## What is The Hub?

The Hub is a deal aggregator for watch buyers. We scan Reddit, forums, and marketplaces in real-time and surface the best deals before they're gone.

**Strengths:**
- Real-time deal aggregation from 10+ sources
- Instant alerts when deals match your criteria
- AI-powered deal scoring (separates good from great)
- Speed — we find deals in minutes, not hours

**Limitations:**
- Market analytics are basic (we're focused on deals, not data)
- No collection tracking feature (yet)

## Head-to-Head: What Matters to You?

### If you're BUYING a watch...

**The Hub wins.**

WatchCharts tells you what a watch *should* cost. The Hub shows you *actual deals* you can buy right now.

Example: A WatchCharts user sees "Rolex Submariner 116610LN average price: $11,500."

A Hub user gets an alert: "Rolex Submariner 116610LN just listed for $9,800 on r/Watchexchange — 15% below market."

One gives you data. The other gives you action.

### If you're TRACKING your collection...

**WatchCharts wins.**

We're not a portfolio tracker. WatchCharts lets you log your collection, track values over time, and see net worth changes.

### If you're SELLING a watch...

**Both help, differently.**

- WatchCharts: See what similar watches sold for
- The Hub: Understand what deals are competing with yours

### If you care about SPEED...

**The Hub wins.**

We're built for speed. Deals on Reddit sell in hours, sometimes minutes. Our scrapers run continuously. You get alerts immediately.

WatchCharts aggregates historical data — great for research, not for catching deals.

## Pricing Comparison

| Plan | The Hub | WatchCharts |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Free | ✅ Basic deal feed, limited alerts | ✅ Basic valuations, limited history |
| Premium | $9/mo — unlimited alerts, AI scoring, Telegram bot | $15/mo — full price history, analytics |

The Hub is 40% cheaper for premium features.

---

## Can You Use Both?

Yes, and many collectors do.

**Workflow:**
1. Use WatchCharts to research fair market value
2. Set up alerts on The Hub for deals below that price
3. When a deal hits, you already know it's good — act fast

---

## Summary

WatchCharts and The Hub serve different purposes:

- **WatchCharts** = "What is this watch worth?"
- **The Hub** = "Where can I buy this watch for less?"

If you're actively shopping, The Hub gets you there faster.
