## Outreach Strategy Notes

**Timing**: Reach out Monday-Thursday mornings (better response rates)

**Sequence**:
1. Start with DM/email
2. If no response in 5-7 days, follow up once
3. If still no response, move to next on list

**Personalization**: Reference specific recent video or post to show you actually follow them

**Value prop**: Lead with what THEY get (free tool, audience value, content ideas), not what we need

**Follow-up hook**: Offer to send them exclusive early access and custom referral tracking
