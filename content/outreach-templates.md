# The Hub - Influencer Outreach Templates

---

## Template A: YouTube Cold Outreach (Email/YouTube Message)

**Subject**: Your audience would love this (watch/sneaker deal tracker)

**Body**:

Hey [NAME],

I've been watching your content on [SPECIFIC RECENT VIDEO/TOPIC] — really dope how you break down [specific thing they do well].

Quick intro: I'm Sydney, co-founder of The Hub. We built a deal tracker that automatically scrapes the best watch and sneaker deals from across the web (StockX, Grailed, Chrono24, eBay, you name it). Think of it like a flight tracker, but for kicks and timepieces.

**Why I'm reaching out**: Your audience is clearly hunting for deals and asking "where'd you cop that?" in every video. We built exactly what they need.

**What we're thinking**:
- Give you early access + custom referral code for your community
- You mention it in a video ("this is how I find deals now")
- We can feature your videos/reviews in the app when relevant
- Your audience gets a free tool that actually helps them save money
- You get credit for bringing them value (and optional affiliate setup if you want)

Not asking you to shill something corporate. This is a legit tool we use ourselves (I'm a sneakerhead/watch nerd too). Just built it because nothing good existed.

Down to chat more? Happy to show you a demo or just send you access to try it out first.

**P.S.** No pressure if you're not into it. Either way, keep making great content 🔥

## Template B: Instagram/TikTok DM (Casual & Short)

Hey [NAME]! Been following your content for a minute — your [recent post/video about X] was fire 🔥

Real quick: We built a deal tracker for watches/sneakers (auto-finds the best prices across StockX, Grailed, Chrono24, etc.). Basically a must-have for anyone actually buying this stuff.

Thought your audience would eat it up. Want to try it out? Can send you early access + a custom code for your followers if you dig it.

No strings attached — just think it'd be genuinely useful for your community. 

Let me know!

## Template C: Collaboration Pitch (Partnership-Focused)

**Subject**: Partnership idea - The Hub x [CHANNEL NAME]

Hey [NAME],

Sydney here, co-founder of The Hub. Been following your work on [platform] — you've built something really special with your community.

**What we're building**: A deal aggregator for watches and sneakers. Think Honey, but actually good, and built specifically for enthusiasts. We scrape 50+ sources (StockX, Grailed, Chrono24, eBay, r/WatchExchange, etc.) and surface the best deals in real-time.

**Why I'm reaching out**: We're looking for a few creators to partner with for launch. Not just "hey promote this" — actual collaboration.

**What that looks like**:
1. **You get**: Early access, custom referral tracking, featured placement in the app
2. **Your content**: We can feature your reviews/videos alongside relevant deals (with full credit + links back to you)
3. **Your audience**: Free tool that helps them find what you recommend at the best prices
4. **Revenue share**: Open to discussing affiliate structure if there's fit

**Example**: You review a Seiko mod or Jordan 1 colorway → we show your video when that deal pops up in our app → your audience watches your content + finds the deal → everybody wins.

**What we're NOT**: Some corporate brand trying to "leverage influencers." We're a small startup (literally 2 people right now) who are into this stuff ourselves. Just trying to build something useful and partner with people who give a shit.

You down to explore this? Can hop on a quick call, or I can just send you access and you can poke around first.

**P.S.** Here's what the app looks like: [LINK TO DEMO/SCREENSHOTS]

## Customization Notes

### For Watch Influencers:
- Reference: Chrono24, WatchExchange, Watchuseek, vintage dealers
- Mention: "tracking Seiko mods, vintage Omegas, Grand Seikos under $2K"
- Tone: Slightly more sophisticated, less slang

### For Sneaker Influencers:
- Reference: StockX, GOAT, Grailed, Nike/SNKRS drops
- Mention: "catching Dunk restocks, Jordan retros, Yeezy deals"
- Tone: More casual, use sneaker culture language

### Personalization Checklist:
- [ ] Insert their name (obviously)
- [ ] Reference a SPECIFIC recent video/post (prove you actually watch)
- [ ] Adjust tone to match their vibe (formal vs. casual)
- [ ] Mention their niche specifically (vintage watches, Jordan collector, etc.)
- [ ] Use their platform's language (YouTube = "subscribers", TikTok = "followers", IG = "community")

## Follow-Up Template (If No Response After 5-7 Days)

Hey [NAME],

Totally get it if you're swamped — just wanted to bump this in case it got buried.

Still think your audience would really dig what we built. Happy to send you access with zero commitment, just try it out and see if it's useful.

If you're not interested, all good — no hard feelings. Keep doing your thing 🤝

## Response Tracking

**When they respond positively**:
1. Send demo link + login immediately
2. Create custom referral code: `[CHANNELNAME]HUB` or `HUB[NAME]`
3. Schedule follow-up in 3-5 days to check if they tried it
4. Ask what they think + what features would help them most

**When they ask about money**:
- Be transparent: We're not paying for posts (startup budget)
- Offer: Revenue share on their referral conversions (if we monetize)
- Emphasize: Free tool for them + their audience, genuine value-add

**When they ghost**:
- One follow-up after 5-7 days
- If still nothing, move on
- No triple-texting (looks desperate)

## Do's
