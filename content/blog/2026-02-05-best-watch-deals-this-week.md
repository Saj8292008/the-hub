## 🏆 Headliner: NEW Rolex Submariner 126613LN Two-Tone

**Price:** $19,900  
**Condition:** New (stickered)  
**Source:** r/Watchexchange  
**Why it's notable:** Unworn, full kit, 2026 warranty card

The two-tone Submariner is having a moment. After years of being overshadowed by its stainless steel sibling, collectors are rediscovering the appeal of the Rolesor configuration.

This particular example is stickered — meaning it's never been sized or worn. At $19,900, it's priced below current market averages for the reference.

**Market context:** 126613LN listings typically range from $18,500-$22,000 depending on condition. Stickered examples command a premium, making this competitive.

## 🎯 Best Value: Rolex Daytona 116500LN Black Dial

**Price:** $27,500  
**Condition:** Excellent (2023 production)  
**Source:** r/Watchexchange  
**Why it's notable:** Full set, recent production, below retail equivalent

The ceramic Daytona remains one of the most sought-after Rolex references. While the white "Panda" dial gets most of the attention, the black dial is arguably more versatile and typically trades 5-10% lower.

2023 production means this example is well within Rolex's warranty coverage (5 years from purchase date at AD). Full documentation included.

**Market context:** Black dial 116500LNs have been trading between $26,000-$30,000 recently. This example is priced at the lower end of that range with recent provenance.

## 💎 German Engineering: Glashütte Original SeaQ Pano Date

**Price:** $8,000  
**Condition:** Excellent  
**Source:** r/Watchexchange  
**Why it's notable:** Retail $12,000+, serious discount on German haute horlogerie

If you want something different from the Swiss big three, Glashütte Original offers compelling German alternatives. The SeaQ Pano Date combines their signature panorama date with a modern dive watch aesthetic.

At $8,000, this represents roughly 33% below retail — significant for a brand that rarely discounts and holds value well.

**Market context:** Pre-owned SeaQ Pano Date examples typically trade between $7,500-$9,500. This pricing is competitive, especially with full kit.

## ⚡ Limited Edition: Bell & Ross BR V2-94 Full Lum

**Price:** $2,350  
**Condition:** Full set  
**Source:** r/Watchexchange  
**Why it's notable:** Limited edition with full luminous dial treatment

Bell & Ross doesn't get as much collector attention as it deserves. The BR V2-94 Full Lum is a chronograph with a fully luminous dial — it practically glows in the dark.

Limited production pieces like this tend to appreciate over time as they become harder to find. At $2,350 with full kit, this is priced to move.

**For:** Collectors who want something different, lume enthusiasts, pilot watch fans

## 📈 Market Notes

**Rolex:** Submariner and Daytona prices remain stable. No major shifts this week. Stainless steel sport models continue to trade well below 2022 peaks.

**Omega:** Speedmaster Professional pricing holding steady around $5,500-$6,500 for modern references. Vintage and limited editions command premiums.

**German watches:** Glashütte Original and A. Lange & Söhne continue to offer better value than Swiss equivalents at similar price points. The market is slowly recognizing this.

**Affordable segment:** Budget pieces ($200-$1,000) remain healthy. Seiko, Orient, Tissot, and microbrand watches move quickly when priced right.
