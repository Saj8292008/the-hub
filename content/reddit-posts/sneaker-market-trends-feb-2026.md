## ❄️ What's COOLING Down

### **Yeezy Foam Runners**
- **Market Status:** Oversaturated

### **Yeezy 350 V2**

- **Price Range:** Below retail on most colorways

## 💰 Best Value Plays Right Now

4. **Vans Old Skool** — Retail (never go out of style, no need to overpay)

## 📈 Market Predictions (Next 3 Months)

**Will Rise:**
- Travis Scott collabs (always do)
- Salehe Bembury New Balance (limited supply)
- Any Off-White Nike restock (hype machine)

**Will Fall:**

- Mid-top sneakers (except Jordan 1 Mid actually holding okay)

## 🧠 Pro Tips

1. **Don't chase hype on release day.** Wait 2-3 weeks, prices usually drop 15-25%.
2. **Buy wearable colorways.** Black, white, grey, navy — these hold value.
3. **Condition matters.** DS (deadstock) commands premium, but VNDS (very near deadstock) often 20-30% cheaper.
4. **Size matters more than you think.** Size 10-11 has highest demand, best resale.
