## 🧠 Buying Tips

1. **Verify sellers carefully.** Check feedback, transaction history, and references. If a deal seems too good to be true (like that Speedmaster), be extra cautious.
2. **Ask for service history.** A $500 watch + $300 service = $800 watch.
3. **Full sets matter.** Box + papers add 15-20% to resale value.
4. **Condition > brand hype.** A mint Seiko > a beat-up Rolex at the same price.
5. **Don't rush.** If a deal feels "okay," wait. Better deals are always coming.

## 📊 Market Context

Right now is a **buyer's market**:
- Sellers are motivated (economic uncertainty)
- Inventory is high
- Prices are down 10-15% from 2024 peaks
- Best time to buy since 2020

**Don't overpay.** Patience wins in this market.
