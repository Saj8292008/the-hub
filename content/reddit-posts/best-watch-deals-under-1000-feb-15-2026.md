## 🧠 Buying Tips

1. **Always ask for service history.** A $500 watch + $300 service = $800 watch.
2. **Full sets matter.** Box + papers add 15-20% to resale value.
3. **Condition > brand hype.** A mint Seiko > a beat-up Rolex at the same price.
4. **Buy from reputable sellers.** Check feedback, post history, verify with mods if needed.

## 📊 Market Context

Right now is a **buyer's market**:
- Sellers are motivated (economic uncertainty)
- Inventory is high
- Prices are down 10-15% from 2024 peaks
- Best time to buy since 2020

**Don't overpay.** If a deal feels "okay," wait a week. Better deals are coming.
