Subject: Deal alerts for G-Shock collectors (your 31K subs would love this)

Hey there,

Your channel is THE go-to for G-Shock reviews, and I wanted to connect about a platform I'm building that your audience would genuinely benefit from.

**The Hub** is a real-time deal aggregator for watches (and sneakers). We track prices across 50+ retailers and alert when something hits a genuinely good price. For G-Shocks specifically, we're tracking:
- Amazon Lightning Deals
- eBay auction patterns
- Casio official store sales  
- Third-party retailer clearances
- Import deals (JDM models, etc.)

**Why this matters for your channel:**
- Your tough tests and reviews help people decide WHICH G-Shock to buy
- Our platform helps them find WHERE to buy it at the best price
- Combined = killer value prop for your 31.4K subscribers

**Partnership opportunity:**
- Early access to G-Shock deal alerts (great for video content: "This model I reviewed is 30% off right now")
- Feature your reviews on our platform (with attribution + links back to your channel)
- Affiliate revenue share when viewers buy through your links

We're launching publicly in March 2026, but bringing on a small group of creators as beta partners now.

Want to see how it works? Happy to give you a quick demo.

Best,
Sydney Jackson
Founder, The Hub

P.S. - Your counterfeit detection videos are gold. We're actually considering adding a "verified seller" feature partly because of content like yours.
