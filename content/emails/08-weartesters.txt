Subject: Performance data + price data = perfect combo

Hey Weartesters team,

Your performance reviews are unmatched - the detailed testing you do helps people make informed buying decisions. I'm building a platform that complements that perfectly.

**The Hub** is a deal aggregation tool for sneakers and watches. We track prices across 50+ retailers in real-time to surface the best deals. Think of it as the "where to buy" companion to your "should I buy" reviews.

**Why this partnership makes sense:**
- You test performance and help people choose the RIGHT sneaker
- We track prices and help people find the BEST DEAL on that sneaker
- Your audience makes informed purchases - we help them save money doing it

**Potential collaboration:**
- Link your reviews to our live pricing data (so viewers can see current best price)
- Early access to deal alerts (great for "this sneaker I reviewed is 30% off" posts)
- Affiliate partnership - revenue share when your audience buys through our platform

**Example use case:**
You review a Nike Pegasus 40. We track that shoe across 20+ retailers. When it hits a historic low, we alert your audience. They buy through your link. Everyone wins.

We're launching March 2026. Want to see an early demo?

No pressure - just exploring if there's a fit.

Best regards,
Sydney Jackson

P.S. - Your budget vs. premium comparisons are gold. That's exactly the value-conscious mindset we're serving.
