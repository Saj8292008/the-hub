Subject: Deal platform for sneaker history nerds (in the best way)

Seth,

Your sneaker history videos are some of the best content on YouTube - educational, accessible, and not just hype-chasing. That's exactly the vibe we're building at The Hub.

**What we're building:**
A deal aggregation platform for sneakers and watches. We track 50+ retailers in real-time to surface genuine deals - helping people buy the shoes they actually want at fair prices (not resale insanity).

**Why I'm reaching out to you:**
- Your 1M+ audience appreciates sneakers for their stories and design, not just clout
- Your on-foot reviews and history breakdowns help people make informed choices
- We want to partner with creators who educate, not just hype

**Partnership ideas:**
- Feature your reviews alongside current best prices for those models
- Early access to deal alerts (great for "this shoe I covered is on sale" content)
- Affiliate revenue share program
- Exclusive deals for your community

**The vision:**
Someone watches your video about the Air Jordan 1 history. They want to buy a pair. Instead of getting ripped off on StockX, they click through to The Hub and find the best available price across all major retailers.

We're launching publicly March 2026. Want to see an early demo?

Looking forward to connecting.

Best,
Sydney Jackson
Founder, The Hub

P.S. - Your "sneakers that changed the game" series is a masterclass in storytelling. More of that, please.
