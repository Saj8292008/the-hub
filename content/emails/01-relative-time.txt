Subject: Love your Casio Oceanus review - partnership opportunity?

Hey Shane,

Just watched your Casio Oceanus S400 review and had to reach out. The way you break down value propositions ("God Tier Casio") is exactly how we think about watches at The Hub.

I'm building a platform that aggregates the best watch and sneaker deals in real-time - think CamelCamelCamel meets StockX, but focused on VALUE finds (not just hype pieces). We scrape deals from Amazon, eBay, Jomashop, and 50+ retailers to surface genuinely good prices.

**Why I'm reaching out to you specifically:**
- Your Top Watches of 2025 video perfectly aligned with our philosophy: quality at accessible price points
- Your audience (58K subs) is exactly who we're building for - collectors who care about value, not flexing
- We just launched our beta at thehub.deals and want voices like yours involved from day one

**What's in it for you:**
- Early access to our deal alerts before they go live (great for video content)
- Potential affiliate partnership (we're setting this up now)
- Feature your reviews alongside relevant deals (with full attribution + links back to your channel)
- No obligations - just exploring if there's a fit

Your Formex Radient Bronze review showed up in our system last week (great pick BTW). Would love to chat about how we could support your content with better deal data.

Free to hop on a quick call this week? Or just reply if you want to see a demo first.

Cheers,
Sydney Jackson

P.S. - That Tuseno Shellback review was fire. We're tracking that one now too 👀
