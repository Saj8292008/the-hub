Subject: Deal platform for the accessible watch community

Ben,

Big fan of your work - your market analysis videos are some of the most level-headed watch content on YouTube. The "accessible luxury" approach you take is exactly the philosophy behind The Hub.

**What we're building:**
A real-time deal aggregation platform for watches and sneakers. Think CamelCamelCamel specifically for our space - tracking prices across Amazon, Jomashop, Chrono24, eBay, and 50+ retailers to surface genuinely good deals.

**Why I'm reaching out:**
- Your 270K subscriber base is our exact target audience - informed buyers who value quality over hype
- Your review style emphasizes value propositions, not just specs
- We want to partner with voices the community trusts (you're top of that list)

**Potential partnership ideas:**
- Early access to deal alerts for content creation
- Feature your reviews alongside relevant deals (with full attribution + traffic back to BWC)
- Affiliate revenue share program
- Exclusive deal alerts for your newsletter subscribers

We're in beta now (launching publicly March 2026) and bringing on a small group of trusted creators as launch partners.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore if there's a fit? No pressure - just wanted to connect with someone who "gets it" in this space.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Sydney Jackson
Founder, The Hub

P.S. - Your recent Christopher Ward content was spot-on. We're tracking some CW deals right now that your audience would love.
