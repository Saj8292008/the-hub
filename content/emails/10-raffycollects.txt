Subject: Deal alerts for collectors (your 84K would love this)

Hey Raffy,

Your collection showcases and rotation reviews are exactly the kind of content that inspired The Hub.

**What we're building:**
A real-time deal aggregation platform for sneakers (and watches). We track prices across 50+ retailers and alert when something hits a genuinely good price. No hype, no BS - just deals for collectors who want to build their rotation smartly.

**Why this matters for your channel:**
- Your 83.9K subs are collectors who actively buy sneakers
- Your deal pickup videos show the thrill of finding a good price
- We're building the tool to make that hunt easier and more consistent

**Partnership opportunity:**
- Early beta access (launching March 2026)
- Feature your collection/rotation content alongside current best prices
- Affiliate revenue when your viewers buy through our platform
- Exclusive deal alerts for your community

**The use case:**
You showcase a sneaker in your rotation. We show viewers where to get it at the best current price. They buy, you earn, everyone wins.

Want to see a demo? Or happy to hop on a quick call if you want to learn more.

Let me know.

P.S. - Your rotation discipline is impressive. Quality over quantity - that's the mindset we're building for.
