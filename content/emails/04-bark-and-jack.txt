Subject: Deal platform for independent watch voices

Adrian,

Your no-BS approach to watch reviews is exactly why I wanted to reach out. The independent voice you bring (especially on your "Watch Experts" video) is rare in this space - and it's the exact energy we're building around at The Hub.

**What we're building:**
A deal aggregation platform that cuts through the noise. We track 50+ watch retailers in real-time to surface actual deals - not affiliate link spam, not fake "sales," just genuine price drops on watches worth buying.

**Why Bark and Jack specifically:**
- Your 347K YouTube + 144.6K Instagram audience represents the informed, value-conscious collectors we're serving
- Your strap business shows you understand what people actually want (quality without the markup)
- Your skepticism of the industry aligns perfectly with our "no BS" approach

**What's in it for you:**
- Early access to deal data (great for content - "here's a watch I reviewed, and it just hit its lowest price")
- Partnership opportunities (affiliate, sponsored content, exclusive alerts)
- Feature your reviews on our platform with full credit + links back to your channel and barkandjack.com

We're launching publicly in March 2026. Want to see an early demo?

No hard sell - just think there could be a genuine fit here.

Cheers,

P.S. - Love the Nylon 2.0 strap line. Simple, quality, fairly priced. That's the vibe.
