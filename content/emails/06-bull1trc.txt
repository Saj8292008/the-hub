Subject: Deal platform for budget sneaker hunters (you're the king of this)

Yo Bull,

Your budget sneaker hauls are legendary - 832K subs don't lie. I'm building something your audience needs: a real-time deal aggregator for sneakers (and watches).

**What we're building:**
Think CamelCamelCamel but specifically for kicks. We scrape:
- Nike, Adidas, New Balance outlets
- StockX, GOAT, eBay deal patterns
- Retail clearance sections (FootLocker, Champs, Finish Line)
- Import deals (Asia-exclusive colorways at fair prices)

Real-time alerts when something dips below its usual price. No hype tax, just good deals.

**Why I'm reaching out:**
- Your whole channel is about finding value in sneakers - we're building the tool to do that at scale
- Your shopping spree videos show the hunt - imagine having the best deals fed to you automatically
- 832K people trust your taste - they'd trust your recommendations on where to buy too

**Partnership ideas:**
- Early access to deal alerts (great for video content)
- Affiliate revenue share  
- Feature your pickups/reviews alongside current best prices
- Exclusive deals for your community

We're launching March 2026. Want to see a demo? Or just DM me on Instagram if email isn't your thing.

Let's talk.

P.S. - Your Virginia Beach location means you're probably hitting the same outlets I do. Small world 👟
