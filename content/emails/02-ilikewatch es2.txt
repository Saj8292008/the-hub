Subject: Platform for affordable watch collectors (your audience would love this)

Hey there,

I run a channel focused on unboxing affordable watches, so I had to reach out about a project I think your 20K subscribers would genuinely love.

I'm building The Hub - a deal aggregation platform specifically for watches and sneakers. We track 50+ retailers in real-time and surface actual good deals (not just "15% off MSRP" garbage).

**Why this matters for your content:**
- Your unboxing videos showcase budget-friendly pieces - we could feature those alongside current best prices
- Your audience is actively looking for deals - we're building the tool they wish existed
- Potential for affiliate revenue when viewers click through to buy watches you've reviewed

**What we're offering:**
- Early beta access (launching March 2026)
- Partnership opportunities (affiliate, sponsored deal alerts, etc.)
- Feature your reviews on our platform with full attribution

We're keeping it real - no BS "luxury for less" marketing. Just honest deal alerts for people who love watches but don't have Rolex money.

Want to see a demo? Happy to show you what we're building.

Best,
Sydney Jackson
Founder, The Hub
