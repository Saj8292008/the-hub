Subject: Daily deal alerts for your 355K sneaker community

Hey SneakerTalk,

Daily vlogs = daily opportunities to share deals. That's why I wanted to reach out.

I'm building **The Hub** - a real-time deal aggregation platform for sneakers (and watches). We track 50+ retailers and surface genuinely good prices, not just "SALE" marketing BS.

**Why this works for your content:**
- You post daily sneaker content - we can feed you daily deal alerts
- Your 355K subscribers are already engaged and looking for pickups
- You showcase rotations and new cops - imagine featuring "and here's where to get it for the best price"

**What we're offering:**
- Beta access to our deal dashboard (launching March 2026)
- Partnership/affiliate revenue when your viewers click through
- Feature your reviews and pickups on our platform with full attribution

Your audience trusts you for sneaker culture and style. We want to be the tool that helps them actually BUY the kicks you showcase.

Want to see how it works? Happy to hop on a quick call or just send you a demo link.

Let me know.

P.S. - Love the daily vlog format. Consistency is key, and you nail it.
