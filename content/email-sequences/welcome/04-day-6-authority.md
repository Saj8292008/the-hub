Hey [First Name],

Here's something most buyers don't think about: **deal velocity**.

It's the speed at which a listing sells. And it tells you more than the price alone.

---

**Fast-selling listings (< 2 hours):**

When a watch sells in under 2 hours on Reddit, that's a signal. It means:
- Price was significantly below market
- Seller had strong reputation
- Watch was in high demand

If you're getting alerts for this type of deal, you need to act immediately. No "I'll think about it."

---

**Medium velocity (2-24 hours):**

These are fairly priced listings. Good watches, fair prices, eventually sell.

You have time to:
- Research the model
- Check comparable sales
- Maybe negotiate 5-10%

This is where most solid purchases happen.

---

**Slow movers (> 24 hours):**

Listings that sit are either:
- Overpriced (most common)
- Niche models with small buyer pools
- Poorly photographed/described
- Seller has no reputation

These are negotiation opportunities. Sellers who've been sitting for a week are more flexible.

---

**How The Hub helps:**

Our deal scoring factors in velocity patterns. A $5,000 Speedmaster that looks like a "good deal" might actually be average if similar listings sell for $4,800 regularly.

We track:
- Historical pricing for that model
- How fast similar listings moved
- Seller reputation and history

The result: A score that tells you if a deal is actually good, not just "looks good."

**Practical tip:**

When you see a deal you like, check how long it's been listed. On Reddit, sort by "new" and note the timestamp.

If it's been up for 6+ hours and seems like a good price, there might be a reason it hasn't sold. Ask questions before buying.
