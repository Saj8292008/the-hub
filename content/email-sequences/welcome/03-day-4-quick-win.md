Hey [First Name],

Most watch deals happen in places most people aren't looking.

Here are 3 sources that consistently beat Chrono24 prices:

---

**1. r/Watchexchange (Reddit)**

The biggest peer-to-peer watch marketplace you've never heard of. 400k+ members, thousands of listings weekly.

Why prices are lower:
- No platform fees (Chrono24 takes 6-11%)
- Sellers price to sell, not to list
- Negotiation is expected

The catch: Good deals sell fast. Sometimes in minutes.

**The Hub scrapes r/Watchexchange every 5 minutes** so you don't have to live on Reddit.

---

**2. WatchUSeek Forums**

Old-school forum vibes. Serious collectors who've been trading for decades.

Why it's underrated:
- Less competition (younger buyers ignore forums)
- Sellers have long transaction histories
- Vintage pieces you won't find elsewhere

We scan WatchUSeek too. Same alerts, no extra work.

---

**3. r/watch_swap**

The younger sibling of r/Watchexchange. Smaller community, but growing.

Why it matters:
- Less saturated = deals sit longer
- More affordable pieces (under $2k sweet spot)
- Enthusiast sellers, not flippers

This is where you find Seikos, Tissots, and microbrands at steal prices.

**Your action item:**

If you haven't set up alerts yet, do it now. Pick one watch you're interested in and set a price threshold 10-15% below market.

Even if you're just browsing, alerts keep you informed without the constant tab-checking.

Happy hunting,
