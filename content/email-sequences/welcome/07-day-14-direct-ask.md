**Trigger:** 14 days after signup
**Purpose:** Clear CTA to upgrade (or stay engaged)

Hey [First Name],

You've been with us for 2 weeks. Here's what you've learned:

✅ Where the real deals hide (Reddit, forums, P2P)
✅ Why speed matters (good deals sell fast)
✅ How to read deal velocity
✅ Why Telegram beats email for hot deals

Now the question: **Are you ready to get serious?**

---

**If you're still browsing...**

That's totally fine. Keep using the free tier:
- Daily deal digest
- Limited alerts
- Access to all listings

No pressure. Some collectors browse for months before buying. The Hub will be here.

**If you're actively hunting...**

Premium exists for a reason.

**What you get:**
- **Unlimited alerts** — Set as many as you want
- **AI deal scores** — Know instantly if a deal is actually good
- **Telegram bot** — Real-time notifications with interactive features
- **Price history** — See what similar watches sold for
- **Priority support** — Questions answered within hours

**What it costs:**
$9/month. Cancel anytime.

Less than a coffee a week. Probably saves you thousands on your next watch.

---

**The math:**

Average savings our members report: 15-20% below Chrono24/market prices.

On a $5,000 watch, that's $750-$1,000 saved.

Premium pays for itself on your first purchase. Probably 100x over.

---

**Two options:**

**[Upgrade to Premium →]** — $9/month, instant access, cancel anytime

**[Keep using Free →]** — No hard feelings, you'll still get our weekly emails

Either way, happy hunting.

P.S. If you found a watch using The Hub, reply and tell me about it. Those emails make my day.
