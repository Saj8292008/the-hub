Hey [First Name],

Quick story about why The Hub exists.

Last year, I spent 3 months hunting for an Omega Speedmaster. Checked Reddit every hour. Scrolled Chrono24 for hours. Set up Google alerts that never worked.

Finally found one — but by the time I saw the post, it was already sold. 47 minutes. Gone.

That happened three more times.

I started wondering: there has to be a better way than manually refreshing 6 tabs.

So I built it.

**The first version was just for me:**
- A script that scraped Reddit every 10 minutes
- Text alerts when "Speedmaster" appeared
- A spreadsheet to track prices

It worked. I got my Speedmaster. 40% below Chrono24 prices. Full kit, mint condition.

Then my buddy asked if he could use it. Then his buddy. Then a stranger on Reddit.

That script became The Hub.

**Why I'm telling you this:**

Because The Hub isn't a faceless tech company. It's a tool I built for myself that turned out to help other collectors too.

When you email support, you're emailing me (or my small team). When you suggest a feature, we actually consider it. When something breaks, I lose sleep over it.

We're collectors building for collectors.

That's it. Just wanted you to know who's on the other side.

P.S. What watch are you hunting? Hit reply — I'm curious.
