# Email 6: Soft Feature Pitch — Day 11
**Trigger:** 11 days after signup
**Purpose:** Introduce premium features gently

---

**Subject:** Telegram vs Email alerts (which is better?)

**Preview:** Depends on what you're hunting

---

Hey [First Name],

Quick question: Have you tried our Telegram alerts yet?

I ask because there's a real difference between email and Telegram when it comes to catching deals.

---

**Email alerts:**

✅ Great for daily digests and weekly roundups
✅ Good for browsing when you have time
✅ Works without installing anything

❌ Can land in spam/promotions
❌ Not fast enough for hot deals
❌ You might not check for hours

**Best for:** Casual browsing, less competitive watches, budget pieces

---

**Telegram alerts:**

✅ Instant push notifications
✅ See deals in seconds, not minutes
✅ Interactive — tap buttons to see details, images, similar listings
✅ Our bot runs 24/7

❌ Requires Telegram app
❌ Can be overwhelming if you set too many alerts

**Best for:** Competitive models (Rolex, Patek, popular Omegas), time-sensitive hunting

---

**The speed difference is real:**

On Reddit, popular Rolex listings sell in under 30 minutes. By the time an email lands and you check your inbox, it's often too late.

Telegram alerts hit your phone in ~30 seconds after a deal posts.

That's the difference between "Purchase complete" and "Sorry, already sold."

---

**How to set it up (2 minutes):**

1. Open Telegram (or download it free)
2. Search for @hubtest123
3. Tap Start
4. Link your Hub account when prompted

Your existing alerts will sync automatically.

Premium members also get:
- AI deal scores (know if a deal is actually good)
- Unlimited alerts (free tier has limits)
- Price history on listings
- Priority notifications

But honestly? Start with Telegram on the free plan. It's a game changer even without upgrading.
