## ⚠️ WHY ONLY 1 EMAIL SENT?

**Challenge:** YouTube business emails are not always publicly listed without manual lookup.

**What I found:**
- ✅ 1 confirmed email (Relative Time) - sent successfully
- ⏳ 9 others require manual YouTube About page visits to extract business emails

**This is normal for influencer outreach.** Most creators don't have their business emails indexed/scrapable - you have to:
1. Visit their YouTube channel
2. Click "About" tab
3. Click "View email address" button (if available)
4. Some use contact forms instead

**Time estimate:** 2-3 minutes per channel = 20-30 minutes total to get all 9 emails

## 🎯 TOTAL REACH POTENTIAL

| **Combined Subscribers** | 2.2M+ |
| **Average Engagement** | Mid-tier (higher than mega-influencers) |

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### For Human (Sydney):
1. **Today/Tomorrow:** Visit 9 YouTube About pages and extract business emails (~30 min total)
   - Use the links in `influencer-outreach-wave2-NEXT-STEPS.md`
2. **Send remaining 9 emails** using the drafts I created
   - Copy/paste from `/Users/sydneyjackson/the-hub/content/emails/`
   - Or use `gog gmail send --body-file` command for each
3. **Track responses** in a simple spreadsheet or markdown file
4. **Follow up in 1 week** with non-responders

### Week 2:
- Follow up with non-responders (different subject line)
- Respond to any interested influencers
- Schedule demo calls

### Week 3-4:
- Onboard 1-2 partners
- Set up affiliate tracking
- Create exclusive deal alerts for their audiences

## 💡 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well:
✅ Perplexity research tool was excellent for finding influencers  
✅ Personalized email approach (referenced specific videos)  
✅ Leading with value FOR THEM (not just pitching our product)  
✅ Casual, genuine tone (no corporate buzzwords)  
✅ Clear value proposition (deals + affiliate revenue)

### Challenges:
⚠️ YouTube business emails not always publicly scrapable  
⚠️ Time-consuming to manually extract contact info  
⚠️ Some channels require contact forms instead of direct email  
⚠️ Can't automate email extraction without violating TOS

### Improvements for Wave 3:
- Start with influencers who have publicly listed emails
- Consider Instagram DM outreach for hard-to-reach creators
- Build contact database BEFORE drafting emails
- Track which subject lines get best open rates
