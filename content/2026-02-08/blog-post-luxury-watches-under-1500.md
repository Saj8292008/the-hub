The luxury watch market is heating up, and we've spotted some incredible deals that serious collectors shouldn't miss. From classic Cartier elegance to rugged Oris dive watches, here's what caught our eye this week.

## 1. Cartier Tank - $900 (Save ~40%)

The Cartier Tank is one of the most iconic watch designs ever created. Originally designed in 1917, it's been worn by everyone from Princess Diana to Andy Warhol. 

**Why It's Hot:**
- Timeless rectangular case design
- Solid gold or steel options
- Perfect dress watch
- Holds value exceptionally well

At $900, this is an entry point into Cartier ownership that rarely appears on the secondary market. These typically trade between $1,500-$3,000 depending on condition.

**Score: 7/10** - Great deal for the brand prestige

## 2. Oris Aquis - $1,275 (Save ~30%)

Oris has been making waves (pun intended) in the dive watch category with their Aquis line. Swiss-made, robust, and actually worn by divers - not just desk divers.

**Why It's Hot:**
- True tool watch heritage
- 300m+ water resistance  
- In-house movements on higher models
- Better specs than Rolex at 1/4 the price

The Aquis typically retails around $1,800-2,200 new. At $1,275, you're getting serious Swiss engineering without the luxury tax.

**Score: 7/10** - Excellent value proposition

## 3. Christopher Ward C60 Trident - $1,100 (Save ~25%)

The British upstart that's been challenging Swiss dominance. Christopher Ward offers Swiss movements in British designs at prices that make sense.

**Why It's Hot:**
- British design ethos (clean, functional)
- Swiss ETA or Sellita movements
- 600m water resistance
- Direct-to-consumer pricing

Christopher Ward pioneered the D2C watch model, cutting out retailer markup. At $1,100, this is close to their retail price but available immediately (their new releases often have waitlists).

**Score: 6/10** - Fair market price, good if you want it now
