## 🚀 Ready-to-Use Comments

### Example 1: For [Identify] Post
**If someone posts a vintage watch:**
```
Based on the dial style and case shape, this looks like a vintage Seiko 
5 Automatic from the 1970s. The day-date complication and that specific 
dial sunburst pattern was common on the 6119 series.

Check the caseback for a 6119-xxxx reference number to confirm. These 
typically sell for $75-150 depending on condition and service history.

Beautiful piece! The patina on that dial is great.
```

### Example 2: For "Which watch should I buy?" Question
**If asking about budget automatic watches:**
```
For under $500, here are some solid automatic options:

• Orient Kamasu ($250-300) - In-house movement, sapphire crystal, 200m WR
• Seiko Presage ($300-400) - Beautiful dials, reliable 4R35 movement
• Hamilton Khaki Field Auto ($400) - 80-hour power reserve, Swiss made

The Orient Kamasu is probably the best value - you're getting features 
that cost $1000+ in other brands. Sapphire crystal alone usually adds $200+.

What's your wrist size and what style are you going for? That'll help 
narrow it down.
```

### Example 3: For "Is grey market worth it?" Question
```
Grey market can save you 20-40% but comes with trade-offs:

**Pros:**
- Significant savings (Omega, Tudor often 30%+ off)
- Watch is brand new, just not from authorized dealer
- Some grey market dealers (Jomashop, etc.) offer their own warranty

**Cons:**
- No manufacturer warranty (warranty through dealer instead)
- Can't get warranty service at brand boutiques
- Some brands (Rolex) require AD purchase for future service priority

For brands like Seiko, Citizen, Orient - grey market is a no-brainer.
For Omega, Tudor - depends on if you value the manufacturer warranty.
For Rolex - probably want to go AD route.

Which brand/model are you considering?
