## Deal 1: Rado Musketeer VI - $199

**Target Subreddit:** r/FrugalWrist  
**When to Post:** Day 4 (Feb 9)

**Post Title:**
```
[Deal] Rado Musketeer VI Automatic Day/Date - $199 on r/WatchExchange
```

**Post Body:**
```
Just saw this posted on r/WatchExchange - Rado Musketeer VI automatic 
for $199.

Why it's notable:
• Rado is a Swiss brand (Swatch Group, same family as Omega/Longines)
• Automatic movement with day/date complication
• Vintage piece (80s/90s era) - cool design
• These typically go for $300-400 on eBay

Not affiliated with the seller (u/Hyth17), just thought it was a solid 
deal for anyone into vintage Swiss pieces. Full pics in the listing.

Note: Buying peer-to-peer on Reddit - use PayPal G&S, check seller 
flair/history. Standard precautions apply.
