# The Hub Partnership Strategy

*Last Updated: February 5, 2026*

## Executive Summary

Partnerships are The Hub's primary growth lever. Rather than spending money on ads, we leverage existing communities through strategic cross-promotions, affiliate relationships, and content collaborations.

**Goal:** 10,000 new users in Q1 2026 through partnerships alone.

## Partnership Categories

### 1. Telegram Channel Swaps (Fastest ROI)
**Priority: HIGH**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Partners to close | 5-10 |
| Expected reach | 50,000+ |
| Time to execute | 1-2 weeks |
| Cost | $0 |

**Why it works:**
- Same audience, different channel
- Mutual benefit (no money needed)
- Immediate results
- Easy to track

**Execution:**
1. Find channels posting similar deals
2. DM channel admins
3. Propose swap (they promote us, we promote them)
4. Schedule posts for same day
5. Track subscriber growth

### 2. Discord Server Integrations
**Priority: HIGH**

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Servers to partner | 3-5 |

| Cost | $0 (or bot development time) |

**Options:**
- **Simple:** Cross-promotion announcement

## Messaging Principles

### What Works

1. **Lead with value** - What's in it for them?
2. **Be specific** - Reference their content
3. **Keep it short** - Busy people skim
4. **Make it easy** - Remove friction from saying yes
5. **Follow up once** - Then move on gracefully

### What Doesn't Work

1. ❌ Generic templates with no personalization
2. ❌ Long paragraphs about your product
3. ❌ Asking for too much upfront
4. ❌ Multiple follow-ups (desperate)
5. ❌ Pitching without research

### Response Rate Benchmarks

| Platform | Expected Rate |
|----------|---------------|
| Telegram DM | 30-50% |
| Instagram DM | 10-25% |
| Email (cold) | 5-15% |
| Discord mod DM | 20-30% |
