# Discord Server Partnership Template

## Finding the Right Contact

1. Join the server
2. Check #rules or #welcome for mod list
3. Look for "Partnerships" or "Collabs" channel
4. If none exists, DM a moderator directly

## Initial Mod Message

**Subject:** Partnership opportunity for [SERVER_NAME]

---

Hey! I'm the creator of The Hub - a price tracking tool for watches and sneakers.

We track deals across Reddit (r/watchexchange, r/sneakermarket), Chrono24, StockX, GOAT, and more. Users get alerts when prices drop below their targets.

**I'd love to explore a partnership:**
- We could create a dedicated #deals bot for your server
- Or just cross-promote to our respective communities

We're not trying to poach members - just want to provide value to watch/sneaker enthusiasts.

Would you be open to chatting about this?

## If They're Interested - Bot Proposal

Great! Here's what a deals bot could look like:

**Features:**
- Posts top deals daily (filtered for your server's focus)
- Members can set personal price alerts
- "!price [item]" command for instant price checks

**Setup:**
- We handle all the tech
- You just add the bot
- No cost to you

**In exchange:**
- A pinned post or announcement about The Hub
- Bot credits link back to us

Want me to set up a demo?

## If They Prefer Simple Cross-Promo

Totally understand - simpler is often better.

**Here's what we can do:**

1. We announce your server to our community
2. You post about The Hub in your announcements

We'll send our blurb whenever you're ready. What works for your posting schedule?

## Pro Tips

1. **Join and participate first** - Don't pitch immediately
2. **Read the rules** - Some servers explicitly ban self-promo
3. **Offer real value** - A bot or tool is better than just a link
4. **Be patient** - Mod teams discuss things internally
5. **Follow up once** - Then respect their decision
