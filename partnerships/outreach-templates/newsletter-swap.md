**Subject:** Newsletter swap? [YOUR_NEWSLETTER] x [THEIR_NEWSLETTER]

---

Hey [NAME],

I run The Hub's newsletter - we cover deals on watches and sneakers (price drops, market analysis, "buy now" alerts).

We're at [X] subscribers and growing [X]% monthly.

I've been reading [THEIR_NEWSLETTER] and think our audiences would love discovering each other.

**Swap proposal:**
- You mention us in one issue
- We mention you in one of ours

Simple, no money changes hands, mutual benefit.

Interested?

## Negotiating Larger Newsletters

For newsletters 5x+ your size:

**Offer additional value:**
- "I'll mention you in TWO issues"
- "I'll also post about you on our Telegram (X members)"
- "I'll include you in a blog post about best watch/sneaker newsletters"

**Be upfront about the size difference:**
"I know we're smaller, but our audience is highly engaged - [X]% open rate. Happy to do multiple mentions to make it fair."

## Tracking Results

After the swap:
1. Check subscriber growth that week
2. Ask for their click-through stats if they share
