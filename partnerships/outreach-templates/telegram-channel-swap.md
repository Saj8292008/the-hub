# Telegram Channel Cross-Promotion Template

## Initial Outreach

**Subject/Opening:** Cross-promo opportunity 🤝

---

Hey! I run The Hub's Telegram channel - we post watch and sneaker deals from Reddit, Chrono24, StockX, etc.

Noticed [THEIR_CHANNEL_NAME] covers similar territory. Our audiences would benefit from knowing about each other.

**Simple swap idea:**
- We post about your channel to our members
- You post about us to yours

No money, no strings - just mutual growth.

Interested?

## Pro Tips

1. **Personalize** - Mention a recent deal they posted that was good
2. **Keep it short** - Telegram culture is brief
3. **Offer first** - Say you'll post about them first to build trust
4. **Time it right** - Post during peak hours (10am-2pm, 6pm-9pm)
