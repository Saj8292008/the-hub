## Initial Email - Sponsorship Inquiry

**Subject:** Sponsorship inquiry for [PODCAST NAME]

Hey [HOST NAME(S)]!

Long-time listener of [PODCAST NAME] - especially loved the [SPECIFIC EPISODE] episode where you talked about [SPECIFIC TOPIC].

I run The Hub, a price tracking tool for watches and sneakers. We help enthusiasts find underpriced deals before they sell.

Given your audience is clearly into [watches/sneakers/collecting], I think a sponsorship could be a great fit.

**What I'm looking for:**
- 60-second host-read ad (pre-roll or mid-roll)
- Mention with unique discount code

**What's your current rate for sponsorships?**

Happy to chat more about the product if helpful.

## Alternative: Value-Trade (No Money)

**Subject:** Partnership idea for [PODCAST NAME]

Hey [HOST NAME(S)]!

I run The Hub - a deal-finding tool for watches and sneakers.

Instead of a traditional sponsorship, I'm wondering if we could do a value trade:

**What I offer:**
- Lifetime premium access for you and [X] listeners
- Exclusive discount code for your audience
- Shoutout to your podcast in our newsletter ([X] subscribers)

**What I'm hoping for:**
- A mention on an upcoming episode
- Something like "The Hub helps you find watch/sneaker deals - check the show notes"

No money needs to change hands. Interested?

## If They Want to Interview You

Some podcasts prefer guest interviews over ads. Be ready with:

**Your story:**
- Why you built The Hub
- The problem you're solving
- Interesting finds/deals you've seen

**Talking points:**
- How to spot underpriced watches/sneakers
- Red flags to avoid
- Market trends (what's hot, what's dropping)

**CTA for listeners:**
"Go to thehub.deals/[PODCAST] for a free trial"

## Sponsorship Rate Negotiation

**Typical podcast rates:**
- Small (1-5k downloads): $15-25 CPM
- Medium (5-25k): $25-40 CPM
- Large (25k+): $40-60 CPM

**CPM = Cost per 1,000 downloads**

Example: 10,000 downloads × $25 CPM = $250 per episode

**Negotiation tips:**
- Ask for package deals (4 episodes = discount)
- Offer performance bonus (extra if signups exceed target)
- Start with one episode as a test

---

## Tracking Sponsorship ROI

1. **Unique URL** - thehub.deals/[podcast-name]
2. **Promo code** - PODCAST20 for 20% off
3. **Ask "how did you hear about us"** - In signup flow
4. **Compare to baseline** - Signups before vs. after air date

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Listen to the show first** - Know their style
2. **Note their existing sponsors** - Similar products = good sign
3. **Offer a script** - But let them make it their own
4. **Be flexible on timing** - Podcasts record in batches
5. **Track the episode** - Ask for air date to measure results
