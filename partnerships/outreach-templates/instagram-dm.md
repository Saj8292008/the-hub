# Instagram DM Outreach Template

## Pre-Outreach (Important!)

Before DMing:
1. **Follow them** (at least 24 hours before)
2. **Like 3-5 posts** (spread out over a few days)
3. **Leave 1-2 genuine comments** (not generic "nice!")
4. **Watch their stories** and react occasionally

This warms them up and shows you're not spam.

## Initial DM

### Version A: Short & Direct

Hey [name]! Love your content, especially [specific recent post].

I built thehubdeals — finds underpriced watches/sneakers before they sell.

Free lifetime access + affiliate cut if you want to share with your audience. No pressure either way 🤝

---

### Version B: Question Opener

Hey [name]! Quick question - do you ever track prices before buying watches?

I built a tool that does it automatically and thought your audience might find it useful.

---

### Version C: Compliment First

Your [specific watch/sneaker] pickup from last week was sick 🔥

I run a deal-finding tool - would love to give you free access and see what steals you find with it.

---

## Follow-up (5-7 days later)

Just bumping this in case it got buried! Let me know if you want to check out the tool 👆

## If They Respond Positively

Awesome! Here's what I'll set up for you:

1. **Free premium account** - unlimited alerts, all features
2. **Your affiliate link** - thehub.deals/ref/[their_handle]
3. **You earn $X per signup** through your link

Just need your email to create the account!

---

## If They Ask What's In It For Them

Totally fair question! Here's the breakdown:

**For you:**
- Free lifetime premium (normally $X/month)
- [X]% commission on anyone who signs up through your link
- Early access to new features

**For your audience:**
- Genuinely useful tool for finding deals
- [X]% discount with your code

No exclusive commitment - share if/when you want.

## Story Mention Request

If they agree to promote:

Would you be down to do a quick story mention? Something like:

"Found this tool that tracks watch/sneaker prices - link in bio"

I can send you:
- A screenshot showing a good deal
- Our logo/graphics
- A link for your bio

Or just keep it casual and authentic - whatever feels right!

## Timing Tips

**Best times to DM:**
- Weekdays: 8-10am or 7-9pm (their timezone)
- Avoid weekends (lower response rates)
- Don't DM right after they post (looks automated)

**Response expectations:**
- Small accounts (< 10k): 30-50% response rate
- Medium (10-100k): 15-25% response rate
- Large (100k+): 5-10% response rate

---

## Red Flags (Don't Waste Time)

- "DM for paid promos only"
- Never respond after 2 follow-ups
- Only post sponsored content (no authentic voice)
- Engagement looks fake (comments all generic)

---

## Tracking

Keep a simple spreadsheet:

| Handle | Followers | DM Sent | Response | Status |
|--------|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| @watch_guy | 45k | 2/5 | Yes | Affiliate setup |
| @sneaker_girl | 80k | 2/5 | No response | Follow up 2/10 |
