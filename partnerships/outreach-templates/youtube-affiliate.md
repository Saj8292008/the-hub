Hey [NAME]!

Been watching your channel since [SPECIFIC VIDEO] - love how you break down [SPECIFIC THING THEY DO WELL].

I built The Hub (thehub.deals) - a price tracking tool for watches and sneakers. It finds underpriced listings on Reddit, Chrono24, StockX, etc. before they sell.

Given your audience is always looking for deals, I think they'd genuinely find this useful.

**What I'm proposing:**
- Free lifetime premium access for you
- Affiliate link that pays you [X]% on signups
- No obligation to post - try it first, share only if you like it

Want me to set you up with an account?

[Your name]
