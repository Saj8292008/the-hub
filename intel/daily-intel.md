# Daily Competitor Intel — February 13, 2026

## Status: ⚠️ Limited Scan

**Blocked sources:** WatchCharts, StockX, Chrono24 (all Cloudflare 403)
**Agent status:** Competitor Intel agent failed (OpenRouter credits $0)
**Research tool:** Also failed (same credits issue)

### What We Know
- All three major competitors have Cloudflare protection — web_fetch can't reach them
- Need browser automation (profile=clawd) for future intel runs, or RSS feeds if available
- Our Reddit scraper IS working (129 listings in last 24h) — that's our competitive edge right now

### Recommendations
1. Set up RSS/Atom feeds for competitor blogs (doesn't need browser)
2. Use browser automation for periodic competitor screenshots
3. Fund OpenRouter ($5) to re-enable automated competitor intel agent

### Market Observations (from our own data)
- Active Reddit listings today: watches dominating (Seiko, Omega, Cartier, Tudor)
- Price range: $170-$3,850 in last 6 hours
- Notable: Omega Seamaster Planet Ocean 42mm at $3,850, Cartier Must Tank at $1,850
