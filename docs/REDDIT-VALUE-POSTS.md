## Post 1 — r/Watches

**Title:** I built a spreadsheet tracking grey market vs AD pricing on 50 popular models — here's what I found

**Flair:** [Discussion]

---

I've been obsessively tracking pricing across ADs, grey market dealers, and secondary markets for about a year now. Started with a spreadsheet for my own buying decisions, but it's grown into 50 models across Rolex, Omega, Tudor, Grand Seiko, and Cartier. Here's what I've learned:

**The "grey market discount" isn't what it used to be.**

Back in 2023-2024, you could reliably save 15-25% going grey on most Omega and Tudor pieces. That gap has narrowed significantly. For example:

- **Omega Speedmaster Professional (3861):** AD retail $6,900. Grey market average right now is around $5,800-6,200. That's only 10-16% off. Two years ago you'd see $5,200 regularly.
- **Tudor Black Bay 58:** AD retail $3,975. Grey sits around $3,400-3,600. The discount has shrunk from ~20% to ~10-14%.
- **Grand Seiko SBGA413 "Spring"):** One of the few where grey still makes sense — $4,200-4,400 vs $5,800 retail. That's a legitimate 24-28% savings.

**Where grey market STILL wins big:**

1. **Cartier Santos Medium** — Consistently 20-25% below retail on grey. The supply from European ADs flooding the market keeps prices suppressed.
2. **Breitling across the board** — 25-35% off retail on most models. Breitling's brand repositioning hasn't caught up to secondary pricing yet.
3. **Tag Heuer Carrera** — 20-30% off. Honestly the worst value retention in this price segment.

**Where you should just go AD:**

1. **Rolex anything** — Grey/secondary is at or ABOVE retail on most sport models. The "Rolex tax" is real. Just get on the list.
2. **Omega Seamaster 300M** — The gap has narrowed to 5-8%. Not worth losing the AD warranty and relationship for that.
3. **Tudor Pelagos 39** — High demand, limited grey supply. Prices are basically retail.

**Timing patterns I've noticed:**

- **January-February:** Grey market prices dip. Dealers are liquidating Q4 inventory and holiday returns hit the market.
- **Pre-Basel/Watches & Wonders (March):** Slight dip as people wait for new releases.
- **Post-announcement (April-May):** Previous-gen models drop 5-10% as hype shifts to new refs.
- **September-October:** Prices creep up as holiday buying starts early.

**The biggest surprise:** Condition matters WAY more than box/papers on grey market pricing. A mint watch without box/papers sells for only 3-5% less than full kit in most cases. But a watch with visible desk-diving marks? 15-20% hit minimum.

I'm happy to share the actual spreadsheet if there's interest — still adding models and tracking weekly price changes.

**What models would you want me to add to the tracking? And has anyone else noticed the grey market gap narrowing on Omega?**

**Title:** Guide: How to evaluate if a WTB/WTS price is actually fair (tips for newer members)

**Flair:** [META] or post as a comment template

---

I see a lot of newer members asking "is this a fair price?" on WTB/WTS threads, so I figured I'd share the framework I use. This isn't gospel — just what's worked for me after buying and selling here for a while.

### Step 1: Check Recent Sold Prices (Not Listings)

Listing prices mean nothing. What matters is what actually sold.

- **WatchCharts** — Free tier shows 90-day price trends. Best starting point.
- **r/Watchexchange search** — Search the model + [SOLD] tag. Look at the last 5-10 sales. This sub's prices often run 5-10% below eBay because no fees.
- **eBay Sold Listings** — Filter "Sold Items" on eBay. Subtract ~8-10% for what a private seller nets after fees. That's your baseline.
- **Chrono24** — Good for reference but prices skew 10-15% high because of their fee structure. Sellers bake fees into asking prices.

### Step 2: Condition Grading (Be Honest With Yourself)

There's no universal standard, but here's a rough guide:

| Grade | Description | Price Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| LNIB | Like New In Box. Worn 1-2 times, no visible marks. Full kit. | Full market value |
| Excellent | Light hairlines on clasp/case, only visible under loupe. Full kit. | -5 to 8% |
| Very Good | Visible wear on clasp, light marks on case. May be missing box or papers. | -10 to 15% |
| Good | Clear signs of regular wear. Scratches visible at arm's length. | -15 to 25% |
| Fair | Heavy wear, possible crystal damage, service may be needed. | -25 to 40% |

**Red flags that should drop the price further:**
- Service history unknown on a watch 5+ years old (budget $500-800 for a service)
- Aftermarket parts (dial, hands, bezel insert) — HUGE value hit unless disclosed
- No timestamp photos or reluctance to provide them
- Bracelet sized with no extra links

### Step 3: The Full Kit Math

- Watch only (no box, no papers): -8 to 12% vs full kit
- Watch + box, no papers: -5 to 8%
- Watch + papers, no box: -3 to 5% (papers matter more than box)
- Inner/outer box, papers, hang tags, all links: full value

**Exception:** Vintage pieces (pre-2000). Original box and papers can ADD 15-30% to value because they're genuinely rare.

### Step 4: Seller Reputation

- Check their flair and transaction history
- Look at their post history — are they an enthusiast or a flipper? (Neither is bad, but it sets expectations)
- Newer sellers with no feedback should expect to either ship first or use a payment method with buyer protection

### Quick Formula

`Fair price = Average of last 5 sold comps on this sub × condition adjustment × full kit adjustment`

If a seller is within 5% of that number, it's fair. If they're 10%+ above, negotiate or move on.

**What did I miss? Would love to hear how others evaluate pricing — especially for less common models where comps are thin.**

**Title:** 2026 Sneaker Resale Market: Which models are actually holding value? (I tracked 6 months of data)

**Flair:** [Discussion]

---

I've been tracking resale prices across StockX, GOAT, eBay, and a few other platforms for the past 6 months. Not as a reseller — I just got tired of not knowing if I was overpaying or if something was actually a good deal. Here's what the data shows as of mid-2026.

### Models That Are Actually Holding or Gaining Value

**1. Nike SB Dunk Low collabs** — The general Dunk market cooled off hard in 2024-2025, but SB collabs are a different story. Limited SB releases from the last 12 months are averaging 1.8-2.2x retail at the 6-month mark. The Jarritos 2.0 and the Polaroid collab are both sitting 2x+ and climbing.

**2. New Balance 990v6** — This one surprised me. The v6 is holding at or slightly above retail across most colorways. Made in USA models are averaging 1.1-1.3x retail. The brand positioning shift is real — NB is where Yeezy hype refugees landed, and it stuck.

**3. ASICS Gel-Kayano 14 collabs** — The gorpcore-to-techwear pipeline keeps feeding this. Kith and Slam Jam collabs from the last year are averaging 1.5-1.8x. Even GR colorways hold retail.

**4. Air Jordan 1 High OG (select colorways)** — Not every AJ1 anymore. The market is oversaturated. But "storytelling" colorways (Chicago reimagined, Royal reimagined) still do well. The key predictor: if it references an OG colorway, it holds. If it's a new colorway, it bricks 60% of the time.

### Models That Are NOT Holding Value (Stop Buying These to Flip)

**1. Yeezy anything** — I know this is beating a dead horse, but the data is brutal. Average Yeezy resale is now 0.7-0.85x retail. The restocks killed scarcity, and the brand baggage hasn't gone away.

**2. Nike Dunk Low GRs** — General release Dunks are sitting at 0.8-0.9x retail almost universally. The Panda Dunk effect spread across the whole GR line. Great for wearing, terrible for investing.

**3. Jordan 4 non-OG colorways** — The J4 is still a hot silhouette, but only OG-adjacent colorways hold. The "new" colorways are sitting below retail within 60 days of release.

**4. Adidas anything non-Samba** — Sambas and Gazelles are still doing okay at retail, but nothing else in the Adidas lineup is holding secondary value. Forum Lows, Ultraboost — all below retail.

### The Macro Trend

The resale market is consolidating hard. The "buy anything limited and flip it" era is over. What's working now:

- **Brand collabs > inline releases** (obvious but the gap is widening)
- **Quality materials** — Suede and leather models hold; mesh and synthetics don't
- **The "IYKYK" factor** — Models that aren't mass-hyped but have strong community appeal (ASICS, Salomon, NB) are more reliable than Nike GRs

I'm updating this data monthly. Planning to do a Q3 comparison.

**What are you all seeing in your size ranges? I'm mostly tracking Men's 9-11, curious if the trends are different in smaller/larger sizes.**

## Post 4 — r/frugalmalefashion

**Title:** How I save 20-40% on watches by timing my purchases (no coupons needed)

**Flair:** [Advice/Tips]

---

I've bought about a dozen watches over the last few years and I've become kind of obsessed with getting the best price. Not talking about cheap watches — I mean saving real money on $200-2,000+ pieces. Here's what I've figured out.

### Timing Is Everything

**January-February** is the best time to buy, full stop. Here's why:

1. **Post-holiday liquidation** — Retailers and grey market dealers are dumping Q4 inventory. Gift returns hit the market. I bought a Tissot PRX Powermatic for $485 in January that was $620 everywhere in November.
2. **Credit card bills come due** — Sounds cynical, but the secondary market floods in Jan/Feb as people sell watches to cover holiday spending. More supply = lower prices.
3. **New model announcements incoming** — Watches & Wonders is in March/April. Dealers discount current models to make room.

**Other good windows:**
- **Prime Day / Black Friday** — Amazon grey market prices on Seiko, Orient, Tissot, and Hamilton are legitimately lowest of the year. I track these and the discounts are real, not inflated-then-discounted.
- **End of quarter (March, June, Sept, Dec)** — ADs have sales targets. If you're buying at an AD, go in the last week of a quarter. They're more willing to discount or throw in extras.

### Where to Buy (Ranked by Savings)

1. **r/Watchexchange** — No fees for buyer or seller. Prices average 5-10% below eBay. Risk is higher, so stick to sellers with strong feedback or use PayPal G&S.
2. **Grey market dealers (Jomashop, Ashford, etc.)** — 15-30% off retail on most brands. You lose the manufacturer warranty but get a dealer warranty. Worth it on watches under $2K in my opinion.
3. **eBay** — Use "Best Offer" aggressively. I've had offers 15-20% below asking accepted regularly. Sellers would rather take a lower price than relist.
4. **Certified Pre-Owned (brand CPO programs)** — Omega, Rolex, Tudor, and Breitling all have these now. You get factory warranty on a pre-owned piece. Savings range from 15-25% vs buying new.
5. **Amazon** — Actually competitive on Seiko, Casio, Orient, Citizen, and some Tissot/Hamilton. Use CamelCamelCamel to track price history.

### The Moves That Saved Me the Most

**Stack cashback:** I use Rakuten (3-10% back at Jomashop depending on the promo) + a cashback credit card (2-5%). On a $1,000 watch that's $50-150 back.

**Buy previous generation:** When a new model drops, the outgoing version craters. I got a Tudor Black Bay 41 (old ref) for 30% below the price of the new 41mm when they updated the movement. Same case, very similar dial, significantly less money.

**Buy "unpopular" dial colors:** Black dials command a 10-15% premium over blue, green, or white in most models. If you're not married to black, you save real money. My blue Tissot Gentleman was $200 less than the identical black version on the secondary market.

**Be patient:** I keep a list of watches I want and I check prices weekly. When something drops below my target, I buy. No impulse purchases. This alone has saved me more than any hack.

### What NOT to Do

- Don't buy a watch at full retail the month it releases (unless it's Rolex/Patek and you'll never see it again)
- Don't buy from Instagram dealers without verifying their rep
- Don't ignore service costs — a $1,500 "deal" on a watch that needs a $600 service isn't a deal

**What are your best watch-buying hacks? I'm always looking for new angles. Also curious if anyone has experience negotiating at ADs — I've had mixed results.**

## Post 5 — r/flipping

**Title:** I track 20+ marketplaces for deals — here are the tools and strategies that actually work

**Flair:** [Tip]

---

I've been sourcing deals across a ridiculous number of platforms for the last year. Mostly watches and sneakers, but the tools and strategies apply to basically anything with a liquid resale market. Here's what I've found actually works vs. what's a waste of time.

### The Monitoring Stack

**Price tracking (essential):**
- **CamelCamelCamel** — Amazon price history. Absolutely non-negotiable. I set alerts for anything I'm watching and wait for dips.
- **StockX/GOAT price history** — For sneakers and streetwear. Track the 90-day trend, not the current ask. Current ask means nothing — look at last sold.
- **WatchCharts** — For watches. Free tier gives you enough for basic price tracking. Shows fair market value based on aggregated sales.
- **eBay Sold Listings** — I cannot stress this enough. "Sold" prices are the only real prices. Active listings are fantasies.

**Alerts and notifications:**
- **Google Alerts** — Set up alerts for specific model names + "sale" or "deal." Catches blog posts and retailer promotions.
- **Slickdeals alerts** — Set keyword alerts for your categories. The community catches deals fast, but the real value is the comment section telling you if the deal is actually good.
- **Reddit keyword monitoring** — I use custom RSS feeds for searches on r/Watchexchange, r/sneakermarket, and r/hardwareswap. When a WTS post matches my criteria, I see it in my feed reader within minutes.

**Marketplace scanning:**
- **Facebook Marketplace** — Still the #1 source for underpriced items from non-enthusiasts. The search sucks, so I check it manually 2-3 times a day for specific terms. Most of my best pickups come from here — people pricing based on what they paid years ago, not current market.
- **OfferUp / Mercari** — Hit or miss. Mercari is better for sneakers; OfferUp is better for watches and electronics in my experience. Both have a lot of noise.
- **Japanese auction sites (Buyee/Yahoo Auctions Japan)** — Slept-on source for watches. Japanese buyers are meticulous with condition, and domestic pricing is often 10-20% below US market. Shipping and proxy fees eat some of that, but on $500+ items it's still net positive.

### Strategies That Actually Move the Needle

**1. Know your margins BEFORE you buy.** I have a spreadsheet with target buy prices and expected sell prices for ~100 items I'm willing to flip. If I see something below my target buy, I don't think — I just buy. Removes emotion entirely.

**2. Speed matters more than negotiation.** On marketplace deals, the first person to show up with cash wins. I've lost more deals being slow than being cheap. I respond within minutes and offer to pick up same day.

**3. Arbitrage between platforms is real but shrinking.** StockX-to-eBay arbitrage on sneakers still exists in the 8-12% range after fees on certain models, but it's getting tighter. The bigger arbitrage is local-to-online: Facebook Marketplace buy → eBay or StockX sell.

**4. Seasonal buying calendar:** Every category has a cycle. Watches dip in January. Sneakers dip after the holidays (oversupply from gifts). Electronics crater in January (CES announcements make last-gen feel old). Knowing the cycle means you can buy inventory cheap and hold for 4-8 weeks.

**5. Condition arbitrage:** Buy watches described as "used" or "pre-owned" that are actually near-mint, clean them up, take good photos, and list with accurate grading. The difference between a lazy listing and a well-photographed, well-described listing on the same item is easily 10-15% in sale price.

### What's NOT Worth Your Time

- **Bot/cook groups for sneakers** — The margins have been squeezed to nothing for most drops. Unless you're running multiple bots on hype releases, the monthly fees eat your profits.
- **Watching marketplace "deal" accounts on Instagram/TikTok** — By the time it's on social media, it's too late. You need to be earlier in the pipeline.
- **Trying to track everything manually** — You will burn out. Pick 2-3 categories you know well and go deep rather than wide.

I'm still refining my process. Would love to hear what tools/platforms others are using that I might be missing.

**What's your sourcing stack look like? And has anyone found a good automated solution for Facebook Marketplace monitoring? That's my biggest time sink right now.**

## Comment Templates

> Use these as quick, helpful replies when engaging in watch/sneaker/deals subreddits.  
> Goal: Be genuinely helpful, build karma, establish presence.

### 1. Price Check Response (r/Watchexchange, r/Watches)
> That's a solid price. Last 5 on eBay sold went for $X-Y, and r/watchexchange usually runs 5-10% below that. I'd say this is fair/slightly above/a good deal.

### 2. Grey Market vs AD Question (r/Watches)
> For that model, grey market will save you about X%. The tradeoff is you lose the manufacturer warranty and get a dealer warranty instead. On anything under $2K I'd go grey personally — the savings outweigh the warranty risk.

### 3. "Is this watch worth it?" (r/Watches)
> I own one / handled one recently — the finishing is genuinely impressive for the price point. The movement is [solid/nothing special], but the dial work and case finishing punch above its weight. Best value in this segment IMO.

### 4. Sneaker Legit Check Help (r/Sneakers)
> Check the stitching on the tongue tag and the shape of the toe box from the side profile — those are the two hardest things to replicate. Also compare the font on the size tag to a retail reference on CheckCheck's database. What app/source did you buy from?

### 5. "Should I buy now or wait?" (r/frugalmalefashion)
> Based on price history, this model tends to hit its lowest around [January/Prime Day/Black Friday]. Current price is about X% above the historical low. If you can wait, I'd hold. If you need it now, this is still a fair price — just not the best it'll be.

### 6. Marketplace Pricing Advice (r/flipping)
> eBay sold listings are your friend here. Filter by "Sold" and check the last 30 days. After fees (~13%) and shipping, your net on that item would be roughly $X. Work backwards from there for your buy price.

### 7. Condition/Value Question (r/Watchexchange)
> Missing box/papers typically costs 8-12% vs full kit on modern pieces. On this model specifically, papers matter more than the box because [warranty transfer / service history]. I'd adjust your price down by about $X.

### 8. "Best watch under $X?" (r/Watches)
> At that budget, the usual suspects are [Seiko Presage / Orient Star / Hamilton Khaki / Tissot PRX]. Honestly comes down to whether you want dressy, sporty, or everyday. What's your wrist size and what's the use case?

### 9. New Balance vs Nike Question (r/Sneakers)
> NB 990 series for comfort and longevity, Nike for style variety and collab culture. If you're buying to wear daily, the 990v6 is genuinely the most comfortable sneaker I own. If you want something that turns heads, Nike collabs still win that game.

### 10. Sourcing/Deal-Finding Question (r/flipping, r/frugalmalefashion)
> CamelCamelCamel + Slickdeals alerts are the baseline. Beyond that, checking eBay sold data before you buy anything keeps you from overpaying. For the specific category you're in, I'd also watch [relevant subreddit or community] — they catch deals faster than any tool.
