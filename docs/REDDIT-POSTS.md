## Value Post #1: r/Watches
*Post as helpful insight, not promotion*

**Title:** PSA: Grey market watch prices hitting multi-year lows on several brands

**Body:**
Been tracking secondary market prices for a while now. Some interesting trends:

**Down significantly:**
- Tudor Black Bay line - down ~12% from 2024 peaks
- Omega Speedmaster (non-limited) - softer than last year
- Tag Heuer Carrera - grey market has solid discounts

**Still holding strong:**
- Rolex sport models (no surprise)
- Grand Seiko limited editions
- AP Royal Oak (recovered from 2023 dip)

**Best time to buy:**
If you've been eyeing a Tudor or Seamaster, now's actually a decent time. Grey dealers are competing on price.

Not affiliated with any dealer - just sharing data I've been tracking. Happy to share more specific numbers if anyone's interested in particular refs.

## Value Post #2: r/Sneakers
*Engagement + subtle value*

**Title:** What's everyone's "waiting for a deal" grail right now?

**Body:**
For me it's the Travis Scott Reverse Mochas. Every time I see them dip to $400 I hesitate, then they're back up to $500.

What sneakers are you watching and waiting on? Curious what deals people are hunting.

## Value Post #3: r/frugalmalefashion
*Intro post - be genuine*

**Title:** I built a deal aggregator for watches/sneakers - would love feedback from FMF

**Body:**
Hey everyone,

Long-time lurker here. I got tired of checking 10 different sites every day looking for watch and sneaker deals, so I built something to do it for me.

**What it does:**
- Pulls listings from eBay, Reddit, grey market dealers, forums
- Scores deals based on discount %, market price, historical data
- Sends alerts via Telegram when something good pops up

**Current coverage:**
- Watches (Rolex, Omega, Tudor, Seiko, etc.)
- Sneakers (Jordan, Nike, Yeezy, NB)
- Cars (mostly enthusiast stuff - Porsches, M cars)

It's free right now. I'm not selling anything, just trying to make it actually useful.

**Would love feedback on:**
1. What features would make this worth using for you?
2. What sources am I missing?
3. Is the Telegram format annoying or helpful?

Link if anyone wants to check it out: [t.me/thehubdeals]

Thanks!
