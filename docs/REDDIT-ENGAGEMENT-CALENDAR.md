# Reddit Engagement Calendar — 2-Week Launch Plan

> **Goal:** Build karma, establish presence, and become a recognized community member BEFORE posting value content.  
> **Start Date:** Week of 2026-06-16  
> **Account:** [Use existing personal Reddit account — NOT a new/branded account]

---

## Ground Rules

1. **10:1 ratio** — For every 1 self-promotional interaction, you need 10 genuinely helpful ones. During this 2-week ramp, aim for **20:0** (pure value, zero promotion).
2. **Comment before you post** — Don't drop a 500-word post into a sub where you have zero history. Spend 3-5 days commenting first.
3. **Timing matters** — Best engagement on Reddit is 8-10 AM EST (weekdays) and 9-11 AM EST (weekends). Posts made during these windows get more initial upvotes, which feeds the algorithm.
4. **Don't batch-post** — One value post per sub per week maximum. Multiple posts in a day looks spammy.
5. **Reply to every comment on your posts** — This boosts engagement and signals to the algorithm that the post is active.

### Karma Targets

| Milestone | Target Date | How |

| 1,000 karma | End of Week 4 | Continued engagement + data update posts |
| 2,500 karma | End of Month 2 | Recognized community member status |
| 5,000 karma | End of Month 4 | Established authority in pricing/deals |

### The "Hub Mention" Protocol

**When someone asks "how do you track all this?" or "can you share your tools?":**

> "Yeah — I actually built a tool for myself that aggregates deals across a bunch of marketplaces. I call it The Hub. Still early but happy to share it if you want to check it out. DM me and I'll send you the link."

**Rules for mentioning The Hub:**
- ❌ NEVER in a post body
- ❌ NEVER unprompted
- ✅ Only in reply to a direct question
- ✅ Keep it casual and brief
- ✅ Offer via DM, not public link
- ✅ Frame it as a personal project, not a business

### Metrics to Track

Create a simple tracking sheet:

| Date | Sub | Action | Post/Comment | Karma +/- | Notable Replies | Hub Mentions |
|------|-----|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| | | | | | | |

Review weekly. Double down on what's working (which subs, which topics, which times).
