**Thread:**

1/ I've tracked 10,000+ watch and sneaker deals in the last 6 months.

Here's everything I learned about finding steals before everyone else 🧵

2/ First, forget StockX.

Not because it's bad. Because by the time something's listed there, everyone knows about it.

The deals are in the sources BEFORE StockX.

3/ Source hierarchy (best to worst for deals):

- Estate sales
- Facebook Marketplace 
- Reddit marketplaces
- eBay auctions ending at weird times
- Consignment shops
- Chrono24/eBay BIN
- StockX/GOAT

Each step up = more visibility = less discount.

4/ Timing matters more than you think.

Best times to find deals:
- Sunday night (weekend sellers pricing to move)
- End of month (resellers need cash flow)
- 6+ months post-release (hype tax is gone)
- December (people selling for holiday cash)

5/ The "weird hours" hack:

eBay auctions ending at 3am EST = fewer bidders = lower final price.

Filter by "auction" + "ending soonest" late at night. Set a max bid. Go to sleep. Wake up to steals.

6/ Learn to read desperation:

"Need gone ASAP" 
"Moving, must sell"
"Open to offers"
"Price drop"

These are your signals. A motivated seller is a deal waiting to happen.

7/ The authenticity equation:

Risk = Reward

Estate sale with no papers? Risky but cheap.
eBay authenticity guarantee? Safe but pricier.

Know your risk tolerance. Factor it into your max price.

8/ The 3-quote rule:

Never buy from the first source you find.

Get 3 quotes minimum. Even for "rare" pieces. You'll be surprised how often you find better.

9/ Platform fee math (sneakers):

StockX: ~12-13% seller fees
GOAT: ~15-20% seller fees
eBay: ~13% after fees + shipping

Sellers price accordingly. eBay often cheaper because fees are similar but less retail buyers.

10/ Platform fee math (watches):

Chrono24: 6.5-8% seller fees
eBay: ~13%
Reddit/forums: 0% (but you assume risk)

This is why r/watchexchange prices are 10-15% below eBay for same pieces.

11/ The "set it and forget it" approach:

- Know your target price for pieces you want
- Set up alerts on every platform
- Wait

Deals come to you. No more doom-scrolling.

12/ What I use:

Built a tool that aggregates all these sources and pings me when something's underpriced.

It's called The Hub. 

Free alerts via Telegram: t.me/thehubdeals

Not selling anything. Just sharing what worked for me.

13/ Recap:

✅ Look before StockX
✅ Time your purchases
✅ Exploit weird hours
✅ Read seller motivation
✅ Get multiple quotes
✅ Know the fees
✅ Set alerts and wait

Happy hunting.

## Thread 2: Grey Market Watches Explained

**Hook:**
```
"Grey market" watches aren't sketchy.

I've bought 4 of them and saved over $8,000.

Here's everything you need to know 🧵
```

**Thread:**
```
1/ "Grey market" watches aren't sketchy.

I've bought 4 of them and saved over $8,000.

Here's everything you need to know 🧵

2/ What grey market actually means:

New, unworn watches sold outside authorized dealer networks.

That's it. Not stolen. Not fake. Just... different sales channel.

3/ Where do they come from?

- ADs clearing stock to meet quotas
- International market arbitrage (cheaper in some countries)
- Corporate gifts that get resold
- Dealers offloading slow inventory

4/ The pros are real:

✅ 15-30% below retail
✅ No waitlist BS
✅ Full manufacturer warranty (usually)
✅ Brand new condition
✅ Often negotiable

5/ The cons are real too:

❌ No AD relationship building
❌ Can't return easily
❌ Some warranty complications possible
❌ Certain brands barely exist grey (Rolex, Patek)

6/ Brands with solid grey market discounts:

- Omega: 20-30% off retail
- Tudor: 15-25% off retail
- IWC: 25-35% off retail
- Tag Heuer: 25-40% off retail
- Breitling: 20-30% off retail

Rolex/Patek? Forget it. Grey = above retail.

7/ Where to buy grey:

Established dealers:
- Jomashop (huge inventory, good returns)
- DavidSW (watches only, excellent rep)
- Authenticwatches.com
- Crown & Caliber (certified pre-owned)

Always verify warranty card is filled out + dated.

8/ Red flags to watch:

🚩 Way too cheap (probably fake)
🚩 Won't show warranty card
🚩 No return policy
🚩 Wire transfer only
🚩 No verifiable business address

9/ My buying process:

1. Know market price (check recent sales)
2. Get 3+ quotes from different dealers
3. Verify warranty coverage in writing
4. Pay with credit card (protection)
5. Inspect thoroughly on arrival

10/ Is it worth it?

If you want:
- The watch, not the experience
- To save 20%+ 
- To skip the waitlist

Yes.

If you want:
- AD relationship for harder pieces
- To walk in and try it first
- Stories about your purchase

Maybe not.

11/ My grey market buys:

Tudor Black Bay 58 - $2,850 (retail $4,075)
Omega Aqua Terra - $4,200 (retail $5,600)

Combined savings: ~$2,600 on two watches.

I'll take the discount over the "experience."

12/ Want to track grey market prices?

I built a tool that monitors pricing across dealers and pings when good deals pop.

Telegram: t.me/thehubdeals

No fees. No upsells. Just alerts.

Happy watch hunting.

## Thread 3: Sneaker Resale Market Analysis

**Hook:**
```
The sneaker resale market has changed dramatically in 2026.

Here's what's working, what's dead, and where the opportunity is 🧵
```

**Thread:**
```
1/ The sneaker resale market has changed dramatically in 2026.

Here's what's working, what's dead, and where the opportunity is 🧵

2/ The big shift:

Nike stopped creating artificial scarcity on many releases.

Result: More pairs available = less resale profit on average drops.

The "everything sells for 2x" era is over.

3/ What's still working:

✅ Travis Scott anything (still prints money)
✅ Limited Jordan 1 collabs
✅ New Balance high-end collabs (Aimé Leon Dore, etc.)
✅ Anything with genuine limited numbers

4/ What's basically dead:

❌ General release Dunks (Pandas are at retail)
❌ Most Jordan mids
❌ Non-collab Yeezys
❌ Overstocked "hype" releases

5/ The new playbook:

Volume game is harder.
Selectivity is everything.

Know which 10% of releases will actually profit. Skip the rest.

6/ Timing is everything now:

Old strategy: Buy on release, sell immediately
New strategy: Buy 6 months later when prices bottom, sell when nostalgia kicks in

The arbitrage moved from "speed" to "patience."

7/ Platform shift:

StockX/GOAT fees keep rising.

Smart resellers are moving to:
- eBay (authenticity guarantee + lower fees)
- Local consignment
- Direct sales (IG, Discord)

Fees matter more when margins are thinner.

8/ Size matters more than ever:

Sizes 8-11 = most liquid, lowest margins
Sizes 4-6 (GS) = slower but often higher ROI
Sizes 13+ = limited buyers but premium prices

Know your size game.

9/ The opportunity nobody talks about:

Used/VNDS sneakers.

Prices on "worn 2x" pairs are 30-50% below DS.
Buyer market is huge.
Less competition from resellers.

10/ Where to find used deals:

- Facebook groups (verify everything)
- r/sneakermarket
- Depop/Poshmark (casual sellers)
- Local consignment

Quality check in hand before listing. One flaw = no sale.

11/ What I'm watching:

- SB Dunk resurgence (coming back)
- New Balance lifestyle growth
- ASICS collab market (underrated)
- Adidas Sambas (oversaturated, wait for it to die down)

12/ My tool for tracking:

I built an aggregator that monitors prices across platforms and alerts when something's significantly under market.

Free. No BS. Just deal alerts.

## Thread 4: Finding Car Deals (Niche Content)

**Hook:**
```
I found a 2019 Porsche GT3 listed $38K under market.

Here's how I spot car deals everyone else misses 🧵
```

**Thread:**
```
1/ I found a 2019 Porsche GT3 listed $38K under market.

Here's how I spot car deals everyone else misses 🧵

2/ Cars are different than watches/sneakers.

Bigger purchases = fewer buyers = more room for pricing mistakes.

The opportunity is in finding those mistakes.

3/ Where dealers mess up:

- Wrong market (listing a sports car in minivan territory)
- Bad photos (hides how nice it actually is)
- Misspellings in the listing title
- Priced to move (dealer needs floor space)

4/ The misspelling hack:

Search "Porshe 911" instead of "Porsche 911"
"Mecedes" instead of "Mercedes"

Sellers who can't spell = sellers who can't price.

5/ Geographic arbitrage:

Sports cars in the Midwest = cheaper
Trucks in California = cheaper
Luxury in small towns = cheaper

Buy where demand is low. Sell (or keep) where it isn't.

6/ Auction timing:

Dealer auctions on Tuesday/Wednesday = fewer retail buyers
End of month = dealers dumping inventory for targets
End of year = "must move metal" energy

7/ The spec premium game:

Know which specs command premiums:
- Manual transmission: +$10-30K on sports cars
- Rare colors: +5-15%
- Low production numbers: research dependent

Find underpriced specs. Profit.

8/ PPI is non-negotiable:

Pre-purchase inspection: $200-500
Cost of buying someone else's problem: $5K-50K

Every. Single. Time.

9/ Where I look:

- Cars.com (filter by days listed 60+)
- AutoTrader (same strategy)
- Bring a Trailer (ending auctions late night)
- Facebook Marketplace (hidden gems)
- Enthusiast forums (964 Registry, Rennlist, etc.)

10/ Red flags:

🚩 "Lost the paperwork"
🚩 Rebuilt/salvage title buried in description
🚩 Price way too low (probably hiding something)
🚩 Seller in a rush

11/ My best find:

GT3 in Ohio. Manual. Low miles. 
Listed $38K under market comps.

Why? Small dealer. Bad photos. Wrong audience.

Called. Inspected. Bought. Still have it.

12/ Want car deal alerts?

Building this into The Hub soon.

For now: watches and sneakers.

```

**Thread:**
```
1/ Stop checking StockX every day.

Here's what to check instead:

2/ eBay "ending soonest" - auctions ending in weird hours have fewer bidders

3/ r/sneakermarket - motivated sellers, no platform fees, deals daily

4/ Facebook Marketplace - casual sellers don't know market prices

5/ Consignment shops - stores need to move inventory, especially end of month

6/ The Hub - I built an aggregator that checks all these and pings you when something's underpriced

That's it. Stop scrolling. Set alerts. Win.
