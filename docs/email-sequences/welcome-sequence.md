# The Hub - 7-Email Welcome Sequence

**Goal:** Convert newsletter subscribers → paying users  
**Trigger:** New subscriber signup  
**Duration:** 10 days

## Email 1: Immediate Value (Day 0 - Instant)

**Subject:** You're in. Here's what you missed this week.  
**Goal:** Prove value immediately, no fluff

```
Welcome to The Hub.

While you were signing up, here's what our members caught:

🔥 Rolex Submariner - $2,400 under retail (sold in 4 min)
👟 Travis Scott Jordan 1 Low - $89 below StockX (42 pairs available)
🚗 2019 GT3 Touring - $38K under market (dealer didn't know)

This is what we do. Every day.

One place. Every deal. No noise.

Reply with what you're hunting - watches, sneakers, or cars - and I'll make sure you see the right alerts.

## Email 2: The Problem We Solve (Day 1)

**Subject:** Why you keep missing deals  
**Goal:** Agitate the pain, position The Hub as the fix

```
Here's the math that's costing you money:

The average reseller checks 12+ sources daily:
- eBay, Chrono24, StockX, GOAT, Facebook groups, Discord servers, Reddit, dealer sites, auction houses...

That's 2-3 hours. Every. Single. Day.

And you're STILL missing the best deals because:
→ You checked Chrono24 at 9am
→ The Submariner posted at 8:47am
→ Sold by 8:52am

The Hub watches everything. 24/7. 
We alert you in seconds, not hours.

Time you get back: 2-3 hours/day
Deals you stop missing: All of them

That's the pitch. Stick around and I'll show you exactly how it works.

## Email 3: How It Works (Day 2)

**Subject:** The 60-second setup that changes everything  
**Goal:** Reduce friction, show simplicity

```
Here's exactly how The Hub works:

Step 1: Pick your categories
Sneakers? Watches? Cars? All three? You decide.

Step 2: Set your alerts
"Rolex under $8K" or "Jordan 1 under retail" — get specific.

Step 3: Get pinged
Telegram. Email. SMS. However you want it.

Step 4: Buy before everyone else

That's it. No courses. No Discord drama. No "GM" posts.

Just deals, delivered.

## Email 4: Social Proof / Win Story (Day 4)

**Subject:** He made $4,200 on one alert  
**Goal:** Show what's possible, real example

```
Last Tuesday at 6:43am, The Hub pinged Marcus in Atlanta.

A dealer in Ohio listed a 2022 Porsche 992 GT3.
Price: $189,000
Market value: $215,000+

Marcus called. Put down a deposit. Flew out Thursday.

Profit after fees: ~$22,000

His words: "I was still in bed when the alert hit. By the time most people saw it, I already had the title."

This isn't luck. This is information advantage.

The same alerts go to every Hub member. 
The ones who act fast, win.

## Email 5: Objection Handler (Day 6)

**Subject:** "I already use [other tool]..."  
**Goal:** Differentiate, handle the comparison objection

```
I hear this a lot:

"I already use StockX / WatchCharts / Slickdeals"

Cool. So do we. We pull from them.

The difference:

StockX = marketplace (you buy at their price)
WatchCharts = data (tells you what things are worth)
Slickdeals = consumer deals (TVs, not Rolexes)

The Hub = aggregator + alerts (finds underpriced items across ALL sources and pings you before they sell)

We're not replacing your tools. We're the layer on top that makes them useful.

One dashboard. Real-time alerts. Reseller-grade deals.

[→ See the difference yourself]

## Email 6: Urgency + Scarcity (Day 8)

**Subject:** The deal that got away  
**Goal:** Create urgency through loss aversion

```
Quick story.

Last month, a member emailed me frustrated.

He'd been "thinking about" setting up alerts for 2 weeks.
During those 2 weeks, The Hub surfaced:

- 3 Submariners under $9K
- 7 pairs of Travis Scott dunks under $200
- 1 GT4 RS at MSRP (dealer allocation)

All sold. All gone. All while he was "thinking about it."

His email: "I need to stop waiting."

Look — I'm not here to pressure you. The Hub will be here tomorrow.

But the deals won't.

[→ Stop thinking, start catching]

## Email 7: Final CTA + Personal Note (Day 10)

**Subject:** Last one from me (for now)  
**Goal:** Soft close, personal touch, clear CTA

```
This is my last "welcome" email.

Here's where we stand:

You signed up because you're tired of missing deals.
I've shown you what The Hub does and why it works.

Now it's on you.

Option A: Keep doing what you're doing
(Manually checking 12 sources, missing deals, wasting hours)

Option B: Let The Hub do the work
(Automated alerts, faster than anyone, more deals caught)

No signup calls. No enterprise sales pitch. 
Just a tool that works.

[→ Get started with The Hub]

If it's not for you, no hard feelings. You'll still get our weekly newsletter with the best deals we found.

But if you're serious about this game? 

Stop spectating. Start catching.

P.S. Reply to this email anytime. I read everything.

## Metrics to Track
