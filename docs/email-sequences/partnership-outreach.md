# Partnership Outreach Email Sequence

*Cold email sequences for influencers, dealers, and potential partners*

---

## Sequence A: Influencer Outreach (YouTube/Instagram)

### Email 1: Initial Reach (Day 0)

**Subject:** Love your [specific video] - quick question

```
Hey [First Name],

Just watched your [specific video/post title] - the part about [specific detail] was spot on. Been following your content for a while.

Quick background: I built a deal-finding tool for watch/sneaker collectors called The Hub. It aggregates listings from everywhere (eBay, grey market dealers, Reddit, forums) and alerts users when something's significantly under market.

I think your audience would genuinely find it useful - especially the ones always asking where to find deals in your comments.

Would love to give you free lifetime access to check it out. No strings, no obligations.

If you like it, maybe we could explore something more formal (affiliate partnership, exclusive deals for your audience, etc.).

Either way, keep making great content.

P.S. - Here's a 2-min demo if you want to see how it works: [link]

### Email 2: Follow-Up (Day 4)

**Subject:** Re: Love your [specific video] - quick question

```
Hey [First Name],

Following up on my email from earlier this week.

I know creators get a ton of these - I'll keep it brief:

- Free tool for finding deals
- Your audience would actually use it
- Happy to set up affiliate commission if you want to share it

If it's not a fit, no worries at all. Just didn't want this to get buried.

Here if you want to chat.

### Email 3: Final Follow-Up (Day 10)

**Subject:** Last ping - then I'll leave you alone

```
Hey [First Name],

Last email from me on this.

The offer stands: free access to The Hub, potential affiliate partnership, no obligations.

If timing is bad or it's just not interesting, totally get it. I'll take your non-response as a "not now" and circle back in a few months.

Keep killing it with the content.

## Sequence B: Grey Market Dealer Partnership

### Email 1: Initial Pitch (Day 0)

**Subject:** Partnership idea - sending you qualified watch buyers

```
Hi [Name/Team],

I run The Hub - a deal aggregator for watch collectors. We surface listings from across the web (eBay, forums, grey market) and alert our users when we spot good deals.

Here's the pitch: I'd like to feature [Dealer Name] listings to our audience.

**What you get:**
- Qualified buyers actively looking for deals
- Traffic from engaged collectors
- Featured placement when you have competitive pricing

**What I'd need:**
- Access to your current inventory/pricing (API or spreadsheet)
- Affiliate commission on sales we drive (negotiable)
- Or: ability to link directly with your tracking

**Why this works:**
Your audience and mine overlap exactly. Collectors looking for value. Rather than compete, let me send you buyers.

Happy to hop on a quick call to discuss. Or if you have a partnerships contact, please connect me.

Best,
[Your name]
The Hub
[website]
```

### Email 2: Follow-Up (Day 5)

**Subject:** Re: Partnership idea - sending you qualified watch buyers

```
Hi [Name/Team],

Wanted to bump this - I think there's a real opportunity here.

Quick context on our audience:
- [X] Telegram subscribers (deal-focused collectors)
- [X] monthly website visitors
- Average order value on tracked purchases: $[X]

We're already featuring some dealers in our alerts. Would love to include [Dealer Name] when you have competitive pricing.

Let me know if there's a better contact for partnerships, or if a quick call would help.

Best,
[Your name]
```

### Email 3: Value-Add Follow-Up (Day 12)

**Subject:** Featuring [Dealer Name] this week

```
Hi [Name/Team],

Quick update: I noticed you have a [specific watch model] priced competitively right now. Planning to feature it to our audience this week regardless of partnership.

Would love to formalize something so you can track conversions from The Hub - and so we can prioritize your inventory in our alerts.

If there's any interest, I'm an easy yes on a call.

Either way, great pricing on that [model].

## Sequence C: Consignment Shop Partnership

### Email 1: Local Shop Outreach (Day 0)

**Subject:** Helping you move sneaker inventory faster

```
Hey [Shop Name] team,

I run a deal alert service for sneaker collectors called The Hub. We've got [X] followers who get pinged when we find good deals.

Proposal: I'd love to feature your inventory to our audience.

**How it would work:**
- You share your current stock (photos + prices)
- I feature anything priced competitively to our deal hunters
- You get foot traffic / sales
- I get a small commission on purchases (negotiable)

**Why this makes sense:**
Your inventory already exists. My audience is already looking. Let me connect the two.

I'm local to [City] - happy to stop by and chat through details.

Best,
[Your name]
The Hub
```

### Email 2: Follow-Up (Day 5)

**Subject:** Re: Helping you move sneaker inventory faster

```
Hey team,

Following up on my email about featuring your inventory to deal hunters.

Totally understand if you're not set up for this kind of partnership - some shops prefer to keep things in-house.

If there's any interest, I'm flexible on how we structure it. Could be:
- Affiliate commission
- Flat fee per sale
- Even just a shoutout for early access

Let me know. Or I can swing by the shop sometime to chat.

## Sequence D: Affiliate Network Pitch (for Impact/CJ)

### Email 1: Application Follow-Up (Day 3 after applying)

**Subject:** Application follow-up - [Program Name] affiliate

```
Hi [Name/Team],

I recently applied to join [Brand Name]'s affiliate program through [Network]. Wanted to follow up with some additional context:

**About The Hub:**
- Deal aggregator for watch and sneaker collectors
- [X] Telegram subscribers, [X] monthly web visitors
- Audience actively seeks purchasing recommendations
- Average tracked purchase: $[X]

**Why we'd be a good fit:**
Our entire model is helping collectors find good deals. When we feature a listing, our audience clicks and buys - that's the whole point.

We're selective about what we promote (only genuinely good deals), which means higher conversion rates than typical affiliates.

Happy to provide any additional information needed for approval.

Best,
[Your name]
The Hub
[website]

## Email Templates for Specific Situations

### When Influencer Responds Positively

```
Subject: Re: [previous subject]

Awesome! Really appreciate you being open to this.

Here's your setup:
- Premium access: [login/link]
- Your affiliate link: [link] (you earn $X per signup)
- Exclusive deals: I'll ping you first when something major hits

For sharing with your audience, here's a simple angle: "Tool that finds watch/sneaker deals so you don't have to manually check 10 sites."

No rush on mentioning it - just use it first and share if you genuinely like it.

If you want to hop on a quick call to walk through anything, I'm around. Otherwise, the tool should be self-explanatory.

Thanks again!

### When Dealer Asks About Terms

```
Subject: Re: [previous subject]

Great question. Here's what I'm thinking:

**Option A: Affiliate Commission**
- X% commission on sales driven from The Hub
- Tracked via unique link or promo code
- Paid monthly

**Option B: Flat Fee**
- $X per featured listing
- Guaranteed visibility to our [X] subscribers
- No commission on sales

**Option C: Revenue Share**
- Lower commission (X%) + lower flat fee ($X)
- Combines both models

Totally open to discussing what works best for your setup. Some dealers prefer pure commission (no upfront cost), others like flat fee (predictable).

What sounds most interesting?

### When Someone Says "Not Right Now"

```
Subject: Re: [previous subject]

Totally understand - timing matters.

I'll circle back in a few months when things might be different. In the meantime, if you want to join our Telegram just to see what we're surfacing, link is: t.me/thehubdeals

No obligation. Just might be interesting to see the kinds of deals our audience is catching.

Appreciate you taking the time to respond either way.

## Best Practices

1. **Personalize every email** - Reference specific content/products
2. **Keep it short** - Under 150 words for cold emails
3. **Clear value prop** - What do THEY get?
4. **One CTA** - Don't give multiple options in first email
5. **Follow up** - 3 emails max, then stop
6. **Track everything** - Know your open rates and response rates
7. **Send Tuesday-Thursday** - Best response rates
8. **Avoid Monday AM / Friday PM** - Gets buried

## Subject Line A/B Tests

Test these against each other:
- "Quick question" vs "Partnership idea"
- "Love your [specific]" vs "Idea for your audience"
- "[Mutual benefit]" vs "[What you get]"
- Curiosity vs Direct

Track open rates. Double down on winners.
