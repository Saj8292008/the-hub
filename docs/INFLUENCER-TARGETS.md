## Notes

- Always personalize outreach with specific content references
- Don't pitch in first message - build relationship first
- Offer value before asking for anything
- Track all outreach in spreadsheet
- Follow up once, then move on if no response

*Research these handles before outreach - follower counts change, some may have grown past 100K*
