## Support Templates

### How Does The Hub Work?

**Short Answer (Chat):**
```
The Hub is an AI-powered deal finder for watches, cars, and sneakers.

We:
1. Scan thousands of listings daily
2. Score each deal 1-100 (higher = better value)
3. Alert you to the best ones

Think of us as your personal deal-hunting assistant that never sleeps! 🤖

Try it: Check thehub.com or type /deals
```

**Detailed Answer (FAQ):**
```
## How The Hub Works

**1. We Scan Everything**
Our scrapers monitor Reddit, eBay, forums, and marketplaces 24/7. Every listing gets captured and analyzed.

**2. AI Scores Each Deal**
Our algorithm evaluates 5 factors:
- Price vs. Market Value (40%)
- Condition (20%)
- Seller Reputation (15%)
- Listing Quality (15%)
- Rarity/Demand (10%)

Score interpretation:
- 🔥 90-100: Exceptional - act fast
- 💰 75-89: Great value
- ✅ 60-74: Fair deal
- ⚠️ 40-59: Below average
- ❌ Below 40: Overpriced

**3. You Get Alerts**
- Free: Daily email digest + Telegram
- Premium: Instant alerts + early access

**4. You Buy Smart**
We don't sell anything - we just help you find deals. You buy directly from sellers.
```

### How Do I Set Up Alerts?

**Telegram:**
```
Setting up alerts in Telegram:

1️⃣ Message our bot: @TheHubDealBot
2️⃣ Type: /alert [your search]

Examples:
- /alert rolex submariner
- /alert porsche 911 under 50k
- /alert jordan 1 bred

3️⃣ You'll get notified when we find matches!

To see your alerts: /myalerts
To remove an alert: /remove [alert ID]

Pro tip: Be specific but not TOO specific. "rolex submariner" > "rolex submariner 114060 no date 40mm black"
```

**Website:**
```
Setting up alerts on thehub.com:

1. Log in or create account
2. Go to Dashboard → Alerts
3. Click "New Alert"
4. Enter your search criteria:
   - Category (watches/cars/sneakers)
   - Keywords (brand, model)
   - Price range (optional)
   - Minimum score (recommended: 75+)
5. Choose notification method:
   - Email (default)
   - Telegram (link your account)
   - Push notifications (enable in browser)
6. Save!

You can have up to:
- Free: 3 alerts
- Premium: Unlimited alerts
```

### Pricing Questions

**What's Free vs. Premium?**
```
## Free Tier (Forever Free)
✅ Daily deal digest (email)
✅ Telegram channel access
✅ Website browsing
✅ 3 custom alerts
✅ Deal score explanations
✅ Community access

## Premium ($9.99/month)
Everything free, plus:
⚡ Instant alerts (minutes, not hours)
🎯 Unlimited custom alerts
📊 Price history & analytics
🔓 Early access to top deals
💬 Premium Discord channels
📞 Priority support
🚫 No ads
```

**Is It Worth It?**
```
Let's do the math:

One good deal saved = $500-5,000

If Premium helps you find ONE better deal per year, you're up $400-4,900.

But here's the real value:
- You won't miss deals while they're still available
- You see deals before they're picked over
- You have data to negotiate better

Most premium members say they find their "worth it" moment in the first month.

Try it risk-free: Cancel anytime in the first 7 days for a full refund.
```

**Why Charge at All?**
```
Good question! Here's the honest answer:

Running The Hub costs money:
- AI processing (OpenAI/Anthropic APIs)
- Servers that run 24/7
- Team time to improve and support

We could do ads, but that's annoying.
We could sell your data, but that's gross.

So we offer Premium. The free tier is legit useful (no bait-and-switch), and Premium is for power users who want more.

If you love The Hub but can't afford Premium, just stay active in the community - you help make this place great! 🙌
```

**Deal Score Seems Wrong:**
```
Think a score is off? Let us know!

Our scoring considers:
- Recent sale prices (not just listings)
- Condition description
- Seller history
- Market trends

Sometimes it's wrong because:
- New/rare item with limited data
- Condition details hidden in description
- Recent market shift not reflected yet

Report it:
Reply with the listing URL and what you think the score should be.

We review every report and improve the algorithm!

Note: Scores update as we get more data, so recheck in a few hours.
```

Quick Fixes:
1. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R / Cmd+R)
