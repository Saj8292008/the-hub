### Welcome Email #2 (Day 2)
```
Subject: How our deal scores work (quick read)

Hey {first_name},

By now you've received your first deal digest. Let's make sure you're getting the most from it.

**The Score System (1-100)**

Our AI evaluates every listing on 5 factors:

📊 **Price vs. Market Value (40%)**
Is it priced below recent sales? How much?

🔧 **Condition (20%)**
What's the wear, any issues, completeness?

⭐ **Seller Reputation (15%)**
History, reviews, verification level

📝 **Listing Quality (15%)**
Photos, description detail, red flags

💎 **Rarity/Demand (10%)**
How sought-after is this exact item?

**What the numbers mean:**

🔥 **90-100:** Exceptional. These are rare. Act fast.
💰 **75-89:** Great value. Worth serious consideration.
✅ **60-74:** Fair deal. Not urgent, but solid.
⚠️ **40-59:** Below average. Probably pass.
❌ **Below 40:** Overpriced. Hard pass.

**Pro tip:** Set your alert threshold to 75+ and you'll only see deals worth your time.

Questions about any score? Just reply - we'll explain the breakdown.

Happy hunting,
The Hub Team

### Welcome Email #3 (Day 4)
```
Subject: 3 ways to find deals faster

Hey {first_name},

You've been with us a few days. Here are power-user tips to level up your deal hunting:

**1. Stack Your Alerts**
Don't just set one alert. Set 3-5 variations:
- "rolex submariner" (broad)
- "rolex submariner 114060" (specific)
- "rolex submariner no date" (variant)

Different sellers describe items differently. More alerts = more catches.

**2. Join Telegram for Speed**
Email is great for browsing. Telegram is great for speed.

🔥 Hot deals often sell within 2 hours
📱 Telegram alerts arrive in real-time
⚡ Email digest = see deals 6-12 hours later

Speed matters for the best stuff: t.me/TheHubDeals

**3. Check Weekend Mornings**
Our data shows Saturday 8-11 AM is prime time:
- Sellers post more (time to photograph/list)
- Buyers browse less (sleeping in)
- = Less competition for you

Set a reminder and catch what others miss.

**What's next?**
If you're getting value from the free tier (most people do!), that's great.

If you want the fastest alerts and full price history, [check out Premium →]

Either way, we're glad you're here.

Happy hunting,
The Hub Team

### Welcome Email #4 (Day 7)
```
Subject: Your first week with The Hub

Hey {first_name},

One week in! Here's a quick recap of what you might have seen:

**This week's stats:**
📊 Deals scanned: {total_scanned}
🔥 Hot deals found (90+): {hot_deals_count}
💰 Best value found: {best_deal_summary}

**Did you find anything good?**

Seriously - hit reply and let us know. 

Whether you scored a deal or just enjoyed browsing, we want to hear about it. Your feedback helps us improve.

**If you haven't found "the one" yet:**
That's normal! Deal hunting is a patience game. The right deal at the right price will come. We'll make sure you see it.

**A few things you might not have tried:**
• Natural language search: thehub.com/search → "rolex under 8k good condition"
• Price history (Premium): See what items actually sold for
• Community: t.me/TheHubCommunity - ask questions, share finds

Keep hunting. Your deal is out there.

Best,
The Hub Team

P.S. - Got a friend who's into watches/cars/sneakers? They'd probably love this. Forward this email or send them to thehub.com 🙏

## Community Introduction Templates

### For Sharing in Other Communities
```
👋 Hey [community name]!

I've been using this tool called The Hub for finding deals on [watches/cars/sneakers] - it's basically an AI that scores listings across Reddit, eBay, forums etc. and tells you which ones are actually good value.

Not affiliated, just a user - but figured others here might find it useful since we're all hunting for the same stuff.

Free version gives you daily digest, or you can do alerts. Check it out at thehub.com if interested.

Happy hunting!
```
