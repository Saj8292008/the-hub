## Product Questions

### How Does The Hub Work?

**Quick Answer (Chat):**
```
The Hub is an AI-powered deal finder for watches, cars, and sneakers.

We:
1. Scan thousands of listings daily (Reddit, eBay, forums, etc.)
2. Score each deal 1-100 using 5 factors
3. Alert you to the best ones

Score guide:
🔥 90-100 = Exceptional (act fast!)
💰 75-89 = Great value
✅ 60-74 = Fair deal

We don't sell anything - we just help you find deals. You buy directly from sellers.

Try it: thehub.com or type /deals
```

**Detailed Answer (Support Ticket):**
```
Great question! Here's the full breakdown:

**How We Find Deals:**
Our scrapers run 24/7, monitoring:
- Reddit (r/WatchExchange, r/SneakerMarket, etc.)
- eBay listings
- Specialized forums (WatchUSeek, etc.)
- Marketplace listings

Every listing gets captured and analyzed automatically.

**How We Score Deals:**
Our AI evaluates 5 factors:

1. Price vs. Market Value (40% weight)
   - Compares to recent actual sales
   - Accounts for condition, completeness, variants

2. Condition (20% weight)
   - Wear level description
   - Box/papers/accessories included
   - Any disclosed issues

3. Seller Reputation (15% weight)
   - Feedback history
   - Verification level
   - Previous sale patterns

4. Listing Quality (15% weight)
   - Photo quality and quantity
   - Description completeness
   - Potential red flags

5. Rarity/Demand (10% weight)
   - How sought-after is this specific item
   - Current market demand trends

**What the Scores Mean:**
- 🔥 90-100: Exceptional deal - these are rare, act immediately
- 💰 75-89: Great value - solid deals worth considering
- ✅ 60-74: Fair deal - not urgent but reasonable
- ⚠️ 40-59: Below average - usually better to pass
- ❌ Below 40: Overpriced - hard pass

**How You Get Alerts:**
- Free tier: Daily email digest at 8 AM + Telegram channel access
- Premium: Instant alerts within minutes of deal posting

**Important:** We don't sell anything ourselves. We're a discovery tool. All transactions happen directly between you and sellers on their platforms.

Let me know if you have any other questions!

### How Do I Set Up Alerts?

**Telegram:**
```
Setting up alerts in Telegram is easy!

1. Message our bot: @TheHubDealBot (or tap here: t.me/TheHubDealBot)

2. Send this command:
   /alert [your search term]

Examples:
   /alert rolex submariner
   /alert porsche 911 under 50k
   /alert jordan 1 bred size 10

3. That's it! You'll get notified when we find matches.

Useful commands:
• /myalerts - See your current alerts
• /remove [alert ID] - Remove an alert
• /deals - Today's top deals
• /help - Full command list

Pro tip: Be specific but not TOO specific.
✅ Good: "rolex submariner"
❌ Too specific: "rolex submariner 114060 no date 40mm black dial"
```

**Website:**
```
To set up alerts on thehub.com:

1. Log in (or create account at thehub.com/signup)

2. Go to Dashboard → Alerts (or thehub.com/dashboard/alerts)

3. Click "New Alert"

4. Fill in your criteria:
   • Category: Watches, Cars, or Sneakers
   • Keywords: Brand, model, etc.
   • Price range: Min/Max (optional)
   • Minimum score: We recommend 75+

5. Choose notification method:
   • Email (default - included in daily digest)
   • Telegram (need to link account first)
   • Push notifications (enable in browser)

6. Save!

Free accounts: Up to 3 alerts
Premium accounts: Unlimited alerts

Tip: Set up multiple variations of what you want. Different sellers describe items differently, so more alerts = more chances to catch deals.
```

### What's Free vs. Premium?

```
Here's the honest breakdown:

**FREE (Forever Free):**
✅ Daily deal digest email (8 AM)
✅ Telegram channel access
✅ Full website access
✅ 3 custom alerts
✅ Deal score explanations
✅ Community access (Telegram/Discord)

This is legitimately useful. Most users stay on free and find great deals.

**PREMIUM ($9.99/month):**
Everything free, plus:
⚡ Instant alerts (deals arrive in minutes, not hours)
🎯 Unlimited custom alerts
📊 Price history & analytics
🔓 30-min early access to top deals
💬 Premium Discord channels
📞 Priority support
🚫 No ads

**Is it worth it?**
Depends on you:
- Casual browser → Free is great
- Active deal hunter → Premium pays for itself with one good deal
- Flipper/serious collector → Premium is essential

One good deal you wouldn't have caught otherwise easily saves $500-5000. That's 50x-500x the monthly cost.

**Try it risk-free:** 
Cancel within 7 days for full refund, no questions asked.
```

### Why Should I Pay? / Why Charge?

```
Fair question. Here's the honest answer:

**Running The Hub costs money:**
- AI processing (OpenAI APIs for scoring)
- Servers running 24/7 scraping
- Database storage for millions of listings
- Team time to improve and support

**We could monetize other ways:**
- Ads (annoying)
- Sell your data (gross)
- Affiliate commissions (conflicts with honest recommendations)

**So we chose Premium subscriptions:**
- Free tier is genuinely useful (no bait-and-switch)
- Premium is for power users who want more
- Aligned incentives: we make money when we provide value

**The math for you:**
Premium costs $9.99/month (~$120/year)
One good deal saves $500-5000
If Premium helps you find ONE better deal per year, you're way up.

**Can't afford it?**
Totally fine - the free tier is real. Stay active in the community, share deals, help others. That's valuable too!

### How Accurate Are the Scores?

```
Good question - transparency matters here.

**Accuracy rate:** ~85-90% of the time, our scores align with market consensus.

**When we're right:**
- Common items with lots of sale data
- Clear condition descriptions
- Established sellers with history

**When we might be off:**
- Very rare items (limited price data)
- New releases (market still finding fair price)
- Condition nuances hidden in description
- Recent market shifts not yet reflected

**What we're doing about edge cases:**
- Continuously training on more data
- Human review of flagged scores
- Community feedback incorporated

**Our recommendation:**
- Use scores as guidance, not gospel
- Do your own due diligence
- If a score seems wrong, it might be - trust your knowledge too

**Report issues:**
If you think a score is off, let us know! Reply with the listing URL and your assessment. We review every report and improve the algorithm.

### Alerts Not Working

```
Let's troubleshoot your alerts:

**For Email Alerts:**
□ Check spam/promotions folders
□ Add noreply@thehub.com to contacts
□ Verify email is correct in Settings → Profile
□ Make sure alerts are enabled in Settings → Notifications

**For Telegram Alerts:**
□ Didn't accidentally mute the bot/channel?
□ Check Telegram's notification settings (can override)
□ Try: /status to see your alert configuration
□ Try: /test to trigger a test alert

**For Push Notifications:**
□ Check browser notification permissions for thehub.com
□ Didn't block notifications previously?
□ Try: Settings → Notifications → Re-enable

**General checks:**
□ Is your alert specific enough to match anything?
□ Is your price range realistic?
□ Has anything matching your alert actually been posted?

**Test it:**
Set a very broad alert (e.g., "rolex") and see if you get anything within 24 hours.

**Still nothing?**
Email support@thehub.com with:
- Your username
- Which alert(s) aren't working
- Which notification method you're using
- What you've already tried

We'll investigate!

### Deal Score Seems Wrong

```
Thanks for the feedback - this helps us improve!

**First, here's what we consider:**
- Recent actual sale prices (not just asking prices)
- Condition as described in listing
- Seller history and reputation
- Current market trends and demand

**Common reasons a score might seem off:**

1. **Limited data:** Very rare items have fewer comparable sales
2. **Hidden details:** Condition info buried in description that AI missed
3. **Market shift:** Recent price changes not yet reflected
4. **Variant confusion:** Similar but different items affecting comparison

**To report:**
Reply with:
- Listing URL
- What you think the score should be (approximately)
- Why (e.g., "recent sales at $X" or "this variant is more valuable")

We review every report! If we agree, we'll:
- Update that listing's score
- Improve the algorithm for future listings

Your expertise helps make The Hub better for everyone. Thank you! 🙏
