         Honey         │         The Hub
    (checkout only)    │    (discovery + tracking)
                       │
 PASSIVE ─────────────────────────────── ACTIVE

## What Users Are Switching FROM

Based on Reddit analysis:

1. **Spreadsheets** → Wants automation, alerts
2. **Slickdeals** → Wants personalization, speed
3. **Multiple tools** → Wants one unified platform
4. **Nothing** → Didn't know tools existed (awareness play)

---

## Competitive Moats to Build

1. **Speed** — Fastest alerts win in reselling
2. **Data** — Historical pricing across platforms
3. **Integration** — Connect the workflow (find → buy → track → sell)
4. **Community** — Trusted deal verification
5. **Mobile** — Where sourcing actually happens

## Key Takeaways

1. **No one does it all** — Integration is the opportunity
2. **Free is expected for basics** — Freemium is mandatory
3. **Amazon tools are saturated** — Multi-platform is the gap
4. **Inventory tracking is ignored** — Clear differentiation
5. **Mobile is underserved** — Most competitors have bad/no apps
