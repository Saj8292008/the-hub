## Platform Arbitrage Matrix

### Sneakers (Most Reliable)

| Buy On | Sell On | Typical Margin | Risk | Volume |
|--------|---------|----------------|------|--------|
| Reddit r/sneakermarket | StockX | 15-25% | Low | Medium |
| Reddit r/sneakermarket | GOAT | 18-28% | Low | Medium |
| Facebook Groups | StockX | 20-30% | Low | High |
| OfferUp/Craigslist | StockX | 25-35% | Medium | Low |
| eBay Auctions | StockX | 10-20% | Medium | Medium |

**Best Strategy:** 
- Set up alerts for r/sneakermarket with keywords for popular models
- Focus on Jordan 1s, 4s, and SB Dunks in popular sizes (9-11)
- Buy at 80-85% of StockX lowest ask
- Sell immediately on StockX/GOAT
- Account for ~12% seller fees

**Example:**
- Jordan 1 Lost & Found on Reddit: $230
- StockX lowest ask: $300
- After fees ($300 - 12% = $264): **$34 profit (15%)**

### Watches (Higher Stakes)

| Buy On | Sell On | Typical Margin | Risk | Volume |
|--------|---------|----------------|------|--------|
| Reddit r/watchexchange | Chrono24 | 10-15% | Low | Medium |
| eBay Auctions | Private sale | 8-12% | Medium | Medium |
| Japan (Buyee/Yahoo JP) | US market | 15-25% | Medium | Low |
| UK dealers (weak £) | US market | 5-10% | Low | Low |

| Out-of-state | Local market | 5-15% | Low | Medium |
| End of quarter | Hold & sell spring | 5-10% | Low | Medium |

## Geographic Arbitrage

### Regional Price Differences (US)

**Cheaper Markets:**
- Southern states (TX, FL, AZ) - lower cost of living
- Rural areas - less competition
- Midwest - lower demand for luxury items

**Premium Markets:**
- California - high demand, wealthy buyers
- Northeast (NY, MA) - strong luxury market
- Major cities - convenience premium

**Strategy:** Buy in cheaper markets, sell in premium markets. Account for shipping/transport costs.

### International Opportunities

#### Watches

| Region | vs US Price | Good For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Japan | 10-20% cheaper | Vintage, Grand Seiko, Japanese market models |
| UK | 5-15% cheaper | Currency dependent, grey market Rolex |
| Hong Kong | Variable | AP, Patek, luxury |
| Dubai | Tax-free | Limited editions |
| Germany | 5-10% cheaper | German brands (Lange, Nomos) |

**Considerations:**
- Import duties (2.5% for watches into US)
- Warranty implications (may not be honored)
- Authentication risk
- Shipping insurance

#### Sneakers

| Region | vs US Price | Good For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| EU | Variable | Exclusive colorways |
| Japan | Premium | Vintage, Japanese exclusives |
| UK | Variable | Early releases |
| China | Risky | Avoid (high fake risk) |

**Considerations:**
- Region-exclusive releases can command 20-50% premium in US
- Use proxies (reshipping services) for international releases
- Account for shipping + potential import duties

## Arbitrage Automation Ideas

### Monitoring Tools

```
Price tracking:
- StockX API (unofficial) for sneaker prices
- Chrono24 scrapers for watch prices
- CarGurus/AutoTrader APIs for car prices

Alert sources:
- Reddit RSS feeds (r/sneakermarket, r/watchexchange)
- eBay saved searches with notifications
- Facebook Marketplace alerts
- Craigslist RSS

Calculation:
- Compare listing price to database market value
- Subtract platform fees
- Flag opportunities with >15% margin
```

### Quick Win Checklist

✅ **Low-hanging fruit opportunities:**

1. **Reddit sneaker flips** - Most consistent, lowest risk
   - Monitor r/sneakermarket for deals
   - Buy DS pairs at 80% market, sell on StockX
   - Target popular sizes (9-11 mens)

2. **eBay watch auctions** - Requires patience
   - Set max bids at 85% market value
   - Focus on ending times (Sunday evenings often cheapest)
   - Avoid rare pieces (harder to authenticate)

3. **Seasonal car deals** - Highest profit per transaction
   - Buy Toyotas in December
   - Sell in April
   - Focus on 4Runner, Tacoma (fastest movers)

4. **Currency plays** - Opportunistic
   - When GBP/USD drops, buy UK watches
   - When JPY weakens, shop Yahoo Japan auctions

## Risk Management

### Do's
- ✅ Start small to learn the market
- ✅ Stick to items you know
- ✅ Use buyer protection (PayPal G&S, etc.)
- ✅ Verify authenticity before purchase
- ✅ Track all transactions for taxes
- ✅ Build reputation on selling platforms first

### Don'ts
- ❌ Don't tie up capital in slow-moving inventory
- ❌ Don't buy items you can't authenticate
- ❌ Don't ignore platform fees in profit calculations
- ❌ Don't skip insurance on high-value shipments
- ❌ Don't chase "too good to be true" deals

### Profit Calculation Template

```
Gross Profit = Sell Price - Buy Price
Net Profit = Gross Profit - (Buyer Fees + Seller Fees + Shipping + Insurance + Taxes)

Example (sneaker flip):
Buy: $200 (Reddit, PayPal G&S)
Sell: $280 (StockX)

Fees:
- PayPal G&S (buyer protection): $6 (3%)
- StockX seller fee: $34 (12%)
- Shipping to StockX: $15

Net Profit: $280 - $200 - $6 - $34 - $15 = $25 (12.5% ROI)
```
