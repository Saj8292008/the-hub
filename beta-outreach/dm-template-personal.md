# Direct Message Templates for Personal Outreach

## Template 1: Close Friends Who Collect

### Context:
Use for friends/family who actively collect or flip items. High trust, casual tone.

### Message:
```
Hey [Name]!

Quick question: You still collecting [watches/sneakers/cars]?

I've been building something for the last few months that I think you'd actually use (and I need honest feedback from someone who won't BS me 😅)

It's called The Hub—basically a custom alert system for deals. You tell it what you're looking for (like "Speedmaster under $4k") and it monitors marketplaces 24/7 and pings you when something matches.

I built it because I kept missing deals on r/WatchExchange while I was asleep or at work.

Would you be down to beta test for a couple weeks? Totally cool if you're too busy—just thought of you since I know you're always hunting for [specific item/category].

If you're interested, I'll send you the link!
```

### Follow-Up (if they say yes):
```
Awesome! Here's the link: [beta signup link]

Just create an account and set up a "watch" for something you actually want. The more honest feedback the better—don't hold back if something sucks 😂

Also, beta testers get lifetime Pro access (normally like $100/year) so you're locked in even after launch.

Let me know if you hit any issues!
```

### Follow-Up (if they say maybe):
```
No pressure! If you change your mind in the next week or so, let me know. 

I'm only taking 15-20 testers for this first round, so spots are limited. But you're priority #1 if you want in 👍
```

## Template 2: Friends Who Don't Actively Collect (But Might Know Someone)

### Context:
Friends who aren't collectors but are well-connected or supportive.

### Message:
```
Hey [Name]!

Random ask: Do you know anyone who's into collecting [watches/sneakers/vintage stuff] and is always hunting for deals?

I built a tool called The Hub (deal alerts for collectors) and I'm looking for 10-15 beta testers. Figured I'd check with you first since you know everyone 😄

If you think of anyone, send them my way! Or if you're curious yourself, happy to loop you in.

No worries if not!
```

### Follow-Up (if they refer someone):
```
You're the best! Yeah, have them fill out this form: [link]

I'll prioritize anyone you send since I trust your judgment.

Thanks!! 🙏
```

## Template 3: Newsletter Subscribers

```

```
Hey [Name],

You signed up for my newsletter a while back, so I wanted to give you first dibs on something I've been building.

**The Hub** is a deal monitoring tool for collectors and flippers. It watches marketplaces 24/7 and alerts you when items match your criteria (like "Rolex Submariner under $8k").

I built it because I kept missing grail watches on r/WatchExchange while I was asleep. Figured other collectors had the same problem.

**I'm looking for 10-15 beta testers** who:
- Actively collect or flip (watches, sneakers, cars, etc.)
- Check marketplaces daily
- Can test for 2-3 weeks and give honest feedback

**What you get:**
- Lifetime Pro access (worth ~$100/year)
- Early access to all new features
- Input on roadmap and priorities

**Apply here:** [Google Form or Typeform link]

Spots are limited, so if you're interested, apply soon!

Questions? Just reply to this email.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If this isn't for you, no worries—just wanted to offer since you're on my list. You can unsubscribe anytime at the bottom of this email.

I'm launching a beta for The Hub (deal monitoring for collectors) and looking for 10-15 testers who are active in the community.

### Public Reply (NOT DM):
```
I feel this! I missed a Speedy last month because it posted at 2 AM while I was asleep 😭

I actually built something to solve this problem—The Hub. It monitors r/WatchExchange (and other marketplaces) and alerts you when deals match your criteria.

I'm looking for beta testers if you're interested: [link]

Totally cool if not—just wanted to share since we're dealing with the same frustration!
```

Subject: New project - want early access?

Hey [Name],

You were a customer of [previous product] back in [year], so I wanted to give you first look at something new I'm building.

**The Hub** is a deal monitoring tool for collectors. Think Google Alerts but for r/WatchExchange, StockX, Chrono24, etc.

### DM:
```
Hey [Name],

I've been following your content on [watches/sneakers] for a while—really enjoy your posts about [specific thing they posted about].

I'm launching a beta for The Hub (deal monitoring tool for collectors) and thought you might be interested or know people who would be.

Basically, it alerts you instantly when deals match your criteria (like "Speedmaster under $4k") so you don't have to manually check marketplaces.

Would you be open to beta testing? Or if you have a community/audience who might be interested, happy to offer them early access too.

No pressure—just wanted to reach out since I know you're active in the space!

More info: [link]
```

### Follow-Up (if they're interested in sharing with their audience):
```
That would be amazing! Here's what I can offer:

**For your audience:**
- Priority beta access (limited spots)
- Lifetime Pro tier (normally $100/year)

**For you:**
- Extra perks (swag, extended Pro, etc.)
- Credit/shoutout if you want it
- Direct feedback line during development

Let me know what would be most helpful for your community and we can figure it out!
```

## Best Practices for Direct Outreach

### DO:

✅ **Personalize every message**
- Reference something specific (their collection, a post they made, etc.)
- Show you're not copy-pasting

✅ **Lead with value**
- What's in it for them? (Lifetime access, solve their problem)
- Don't just ask for favors

✅ **Make it easy to say no**
- "Totally cool if not!"
- "No pressure!"
- Reduces guilt, increases response rate

✅ **Be concise**
- 3-5 sentences max for initial message
- Get to the point

✅ **Include a clear CTA**
- Link to apply
- Specific next step

### DON'T:

❌ **Send unsolicited DMs to strangers**
- Especially on Reddit (will get you banned)
- Twitter DMs are slightly more acceptable if contextual

❌ **Be vague or mysterious**
- "I have something cool, want to see?"
- Just tell them what it is

❌ **Oversell or hype**
- "Revolutionary AI-powered game-changer"
- Sounds scammy

❌ **Send follow-ups if they don't respond**
- One message is enough
- Follow-up = spam

❌ **Ask them to do work**
- Don't ask them to recruit others (unless they offer)
- Don't ask them to promote it (unless they're interested)

## Response Handling

### If they say YES:
```
Awesome! Here's the link to apply: [link]

I'll review applications within 24 hours and get you set up. 

Let me know if you have any questions!
```

### If they say MAYBE:
```
No worries! If you decide you want to try it, just let me know in the next few days. 

I'm limiting the beta to 15-20 people, so spots will fill up, but I'll save one for you if you're interested.
```

### If they ask "What's in it for me?":
```
Great question! Beta testers get:

1. Lifetime Pro access (normally $8-10/mo, worth ~$100/year)
2. Direct line to me for support/feedback
3. Input on what features get built next
4. Early access to all new features

Plus, you get a tool that actually helps you catch deals you'd otherwise miss!

If you're actively collecting/flipping, it should save you hours of manual marketplace checking.
```

### If they ask "How much time does this take?":
```
Honest answer:

- Setup: ~15-20 min (install app, create your first "watch")
- Week 1: ~1 hour (testing, giving initial feedback)
- Weeks 2-4: ~30 min/week (just use it normally, fill out surveys)

Total: ~4-5 hours over 4 weeks.

The goal is for you to just use it as part of your normal deal hunting—not extra work on top!
```

### If they're skeptical:
```
Totally fair to be skeptical! Here's what makes this legit:

- I'm a real person (here's my Twitter/LinkedIn: [link])
- I built this to solve my own problem (I'm a watch collector too)
- You're not paying anything (beta is free + lifetime Pro access)
- I'm not asking for sensitive info (just email + preferences)

That said, if it still feels off, no worries! Happy to answer any specific concerns you have.
```

## Tracking & Follow-Up

### Keep a Spreadsheet:

| Name | Contact Method | Date Sent | Response | Status | Notes |
|------|----------------|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| Alex | Discord DM | 2024-01-15 | Interested | Sent link | Watches collector |
| Jamie | Email | 2024-01-15 | No response | - | Follow up in 3 days? |
| Taylor | Twitter DM | 2024-01-16 | Yes | Applied | Sneakerhead |

### Follow-Up Timeline:

**Day 0:** Send initial message  
**Day 1-2:** If they reply, send application link  
**Day 3:** If no response, mark as "not interested" (don't follow up)  
**Day 5:** If they applied, accept and send welcome email

---

## Key Metrics to Track

- **Messages sent:** How many people did you reach out to?
- **Response rate:** What % replied?
- **Application rate:** Of those who replied, how many applied?
- **Acceptance rate:** Of those who applied, how many you accepted?

**Target benchmarks:**
- Response rate: 40-60% (for warm contacts)
- Application rate: 60-80% (of those who respond)
- Acceptance rate: 80-90% (most should qualify)

**Example:**
- 20 messages sent
- 10 responses (50% response rate)
- 8 applications (80% application rate)
- 7 accepted (87% acceptance rate)
- **Result:** 7 beta testers from direct outreach

---

## Pro Tips

**Warm up cold contacts:**
- Like/comment on their posts for a few days first
- Then DM feels less random

**Use social proof:**
- "5 other watch collectors are already testing..."
- "Someone in [community] recommended I reach out..."

**Make it exclusive:**
- "Only taking 15 testers"
- "First-come, first-served"
- Creates urgency without being pushy

**Thank people even if they say no:**
- "No worries! Thanks for considering it."
- Keeps relationship positive

---

*Remember: Direct outreach = highest quality leads. Worth the time to personalize!*
