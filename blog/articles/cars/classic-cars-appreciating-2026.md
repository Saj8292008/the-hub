## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Are classic cars a good investment?**
A: Top-tier classics appreciate 8-15% annually, beating inflation. However, maintenance costs (5-10% of value annually) eat returns. Buy cars you love to drive—appreciation is a bonus.

**Q: What's the best classic car under $50k?**
A: Porsche 944 Turbo ($30k-45k) or Mazda RX-7 FD ($35k-50k) offer best appreciation potential. Both should gain 50-70% over 5 years.

**Q: Do classic cars need special insurance?**
A: Yes. Get agreed value classic car insurance (Hagerty, Grundy, American Modern). Cost: $500-1,500/year. Cheaper than regular insurance but has mileage limits (2,500-7,500 miles/year).

**Q: Should I restore a classic car or buy restored?**
A: Buy restored unless you're experienced. Restorations cost 2-3x estimates and take years. A $30k "project" becomes $80k invested for a $50k car.

**Q: What's the 25-year import rule?**
A: US law allows import of cars 25+ years old regardless of EPA/DOT compliance. In 2026, all 2001 models become legal (R34 GT-R, etc.).

**Q: How much does classic car maintenance cost?**
A: Budget 5-10% of car value annually. Example: $50k classic = $2,500-5,000/year for maintenance, storage, insurance.

**Q: Do classic cars qualify for loans?**
A: Yes. Classic car loans (Woodside Credit, Lightstream) offer 5-7% APR for $25k-500k+. Terms: 5-10 years. Requires 10-20% down.

**Q: Should I store my classic car?**
A: Climate-controlled storage ($200-500/month) essential for maintaining value. Outdoor storage accelerates deterioration.

Classic cars appreciating in value offer exciting investment potential, especially 1980s-1990s Japanese sports cars and air-cooled Porsches.
