## Negotiation Tactics

### How to Save $1,000-3,000

**1. Point out needed maintenance**
"The tires are at 4/32, will need replacement soon ($1,000). Can you adjust the price or replace them?"

**2. Cash buyer leverage**
"I'm a cash buyer ready to close today. What's your best out-the-door price?"

**3. Comparable listing leverage**
"I found a similar 2016 Cayman S for $27k with lower miles. Can you match or beat that?"

**4. Inspection findings**
"The PPI found worn bushings and a slow oil leak. I'm willing to buy at $2,000 below asking to cover repairs."

**5. End of month timing**
Dealerships have monthly quotas. Buy last 3 days of month for best negotiating position.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the most reliable used sports car under $30k?**
A: Mazda MX-5 Miata and Nissan 370Z are the most reliable, with Toyota 86/Subaru BRZ close behind. All use proven Japanese engines with minimal issues.

**Q: Should I buy a high-mileage sports car?**
A: Depends on the car. A 100k-mile Corvette C6 with full service records is fine (LS engines last 200k+ miles). A 100k-mile BMW M2 is riskier due to expensive repairs. Check service history carefully.

**Q: Are older Porsche Caymans reliable?**
A: Yes, but avoid 2009-2012 models with IMS bearing issues. Buy 2013+ (preferably 2015+) for best reliability. Budget $1,200/year for maintenance.

**Q: Is a Corvette C6 a good daily driver?**
A: Yes, but ride is firm. The LS3 engine is reliable, parts are cheap, and it's surprisingly practical with a large trunk. Just don't expect luxury car comfort.

**Q: What's the best used sports car for a first-time buyer?**
A: Ford Mustang GT (2018+) or Nissan 370Z. Both offer V6/V8 power, strong reliability, affordable parts, and easy resale if you decide it's not for you.

**Q: Should I buy a salvage title sports car?**
A: No. Sports cars are often driven hard, and salvage titles indicate serious accident damage. Resale value is 40-60% lower, insurance is difficult, and you'll never know if structural integrity was compromised.

**Q: How much should I budget for insurance on a used sports car?**
A: $1,500-3,000/year depending on car, age, driving record, and location. Get quotes before buying. Corvettes and M2s are most expensive to insure.

**Q: Can I finance a used sports car?**
A: Yes, but rates are 2-4% higher than new cars. If the car is over 10 years old, some banks won't finance. Credit unions typically offer best rates for used car loans (4-7% APR).
