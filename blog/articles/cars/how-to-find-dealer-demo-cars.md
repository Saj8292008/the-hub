## Where to Find Demo Cars

### 1. Dealership Websites (Hidden Inventory)

**How to find them:**
- Filter by "low mileage" (< 5,000 miles)
- Look for "Loaner" or "Service Loaner" badges
- Check "Manager's Specials" section
- Call and explicitly ask for demo inventory

**Pro tip:** Many dealers don't list demos online. Always call.

### 2. Luxury Brand Certified Pre-Owned Sites

**BMW:** bmwusa.com/certified (filter < 5,000 miles)
**Mercedes:** mbusa.com/cpo
**Audi:** audiusa.com/pre-owned

**Advantage:** Demos sold as CPO get additional warranty coverage.

### 3. End-of-Month Clearance Events

Dealers must move demos off books monthly for inventory reporting.

**Best timing:** Last 3 days of month/quarter
**Discounts increase:** 5-8% additional discount if you buy last day of month

### 4. Direct Dealer Contact

Call dealers directly: "Do you have any demo or service loaner vehicles for sale?"

**Script:**
"Hi, I'm looking for a [Model]. Do you have any demo vehicles or service loaners available? I'm a cash buyer ready to close this week."

## Negotiation Tactics for Maximum Discount

### Starting Point: Calculate Fair Demo Price

**Formula:**
New MSRP - (Depreciation per mile × miles) - (Age discount) = Fair Demo Price

**Example:**
- BMW 330i MSRP: $45,000
- Demo miles: 5,000
- Depreciation: $0.50/mile = $2,500
- Age discount (6 months old): $3,000
- **Fair demo price:** $39,500 (12% discount)

### Negotiation Strategy

**1. Point out mileage and use**
"This car has 6,000 miles and multiple drivers. It's not truly new. What's your best price?"

**2. Leverage end-of-month timing**
"I can close today if we can agree on $38,000. It's the last day of the month—help me help you hit your quota."

**3. Compare to CPO pricing**
"I found a CPO 330i with 15,000 miles for $37,000. Your demo should be priced between new and CPO."

**4. Request additional items**
"At $40,000, can you include all-weather mats, tint, and first year maintenance?"

**Expected discount:** 20-25% is realistic. 30% requires perfect timing and motivated dealer.

## Red Flags: When to Walk Away

### Signs of Abused Demo Car

**Exterior:**
- ❌ Multiple door dings or scratches
- ❌ Curb rash on all four wheels
- ❌ Paint chips or touch-up paint
- ❌ Uneven panel gaps (accident?)

**Interior:**
- ❌ Excessive wear on driver's seat
- ❌ Stains or odors (smoking, food)
- ❌ Scratched center console or worn buttons
- ❌ Dirty carpet or floor mats

**Mechanical:**
- ❌ More than 8,000 miles (too much demo use)
- ❌ Service history shows repairs beyond basic maintenance
- ❌ Unusual tire wear patterns
- ❌ Check engine light or warning lights

**Documents:**
- ❌ Car was previously titled/registered (not a true demo)
- ❌ Salvage or rebuilt title
- ❌ Multiple states on Carfax (shipped around, red flag)

**Rule:** Demo should be in near-mint condition. Any significant wear = walk away.

## Warranty and Financing Considerations

### Warranty Status

**Full new-car warranty applies:**
- Warranty starts from original in-service date
- You get remaining years/miles
- Example: 4-year/50k warranty, demo has 5k miles = you get ~45k miles left

**What you DON'T lose:**
- Factory warranty coverage
- Roadside assistance
- Complimentary maintenance (if included)

**What you might lose:**
- Some demos have been "in service" for 3-6 months, reducing warranty duration by that time

**Always verify:** Ask dealer for exact warranty remaining in writing.

### Financing Options

**Good news:** Demos qualify for new-car financing rates (3-5% APR).

**Bad news:** Some lenders consider 5,000+ miles as "used" (higher rates 5-7%).

**Best approach:**
- Get pre-approved from credit union (often best rates)
- Compare dealer financing
- Negotiate total price first, then discuss financing
