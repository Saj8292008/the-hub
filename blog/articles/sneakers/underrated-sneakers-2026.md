## Final Thoughts

The best sneaker investments in 2026 aren't the obvious hype releases - they're the underrated models trading near retail today that will spike in 2-5 years.

New Balance 2002R, ASICS Gel-Kayano 14, and Salomon XT-6 offer the strongest risk/reward: currently cheap, strong fundamentals, clear trend alignment.

The key is buying before hype catches on. Once Complex writes an article or Kith announces a collab, it's too late - prices already spiked 50-100%.

Buy now, wear them (enjoy the investment), and sell when mainstream adoption hits 2028-2029.
