## Why Yeezys Crashed (2022-2026)

### 1. Adidas Inventory Dump

**The event:** After Kanye West controversy (late 2022), Adidas held $1.3 billion Yeezy inventory.

**Adidas strategy:**
- Released stockpiled Yeezys in waves (2023-2025)
- Donated portion to charity (tax write-off)
- Flooded market with supply

**Result:**
- Yeezy 350 Bred restocked 8+ times since 2023
- Scarcity eliminated = resale value collapsed
- What sold for $450 in 2022 → $250 in 2026

### 2. Brand Damage

**Kanye controversy impact:**
- Many buyers boycotted brand
- Nike/Jordan filled the void
- Hype shifted to Dunks, Jordan 1s

### 3. Oversaturation

**2022:** 15-20 Yeezy releases per year
**2026:** 50+ restocks/new releases per year

**Basic economics:** More supply + same demand = lower prices

### 4. No Innovation

**Last true innovation:** Foam Runner (2020)
**Since then:** Recolors of 350, 500, 700

**Market response:** Boredom, moved to fresh designs (Dunks, New Balance, Salomon)

---

## Why Dunks Are Surging (2022-2026)

### 1. Controlled Supply

**Nike strategy:**
- Limited Dunk production compared to 2021
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Collaborations with scarcity (Travis Scott, Off-White, concepts)

**Result:** Demand exceeds supply = consistent resale premiums

### 2. Collaboration Excellence

**Top Dunk collabs (2024-2026):**
- Travis Scott Cactus Jack Dunks: $1,200-1,500
- Off-White Dunk "Dear Summer": $800-1,100
- Concepts "Purple Lobster": $600-800

**Comparison:** Yeezy stopped all new collaborations after Kanye split

### 3. Versatility

**Dunks work with:**
- Streetwear (baggy jeans, hoodies)
- Casual (chinos, button-ups)
- Athletic (joggers, shorts)

**Yeezys work with:**
- Athleisure only (less versatile)
- Futuristic fits (niche aesthetic)

### 4. Nostalgia Factor

**Dunks = Skateboarding heritage** (1985 original, SB line in 2002)
- Gen X/Millennial nostalgia strong
- Timeless silhouette

**Yeezys = Recent phenomenon** (2015+)
- No historical cache
- Trend-based, not timeless

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Why are Yeezys so cheap now?**
A: Adidas dumped $1.3 billion Yeezy inventory after Kanye split (2022). Constant restocks eliminated scarcity. Yeezy 350 Bred sold for $450 in 2022, now $250 with 8+ restocks.

**Q: Will Yeezys ever go back up in value?**
A: Unlikely for 350 V2s (oversupplied). OG releases (Turtle Dove, 750 Boost) may stabilize but won't return to 2022 peaks. Best case: 5-10% appreciation over 5 years.

**Q: Are Dunks a good investment in 2026?**
A: Yes. Top collabs (Travis Scott, Pigeon) appreciate 40-60% over 5 years. Even popular GRs (Panda, Michigan) up 25-40%. Better than Yeezys, stocks, or most sneakers.

**Q: Which Dunk colorway holds value best?**
A: Travis Scott SB Dunks ($1,200-1,500) and Pigeon ($4,500-6,000) are blue chips. For budget: Panda ($140-180) most versatile, high demand.

**Q: Should I sell my Yeezys now or hold?**
A: Sell 350 V2s now (will drop further with restocks). Hold OG releases (Turtle Dove, 750s, Wave Runner) - already bottomed out. Don't expect appreciation, just stability.

**Q: What's the best sneaker investment in 2026?**
A: Nike Dunk SB collabs (Travis Scott, Off-White, Concepts) or Jordan 1 OG colorways (Chicago, Bred). Both appreciate 10-15% annually.

**Q: Why do Dunks resell higher than Yeezys now?**
A: Scarcity. Nike limits Dunk production while Adidas floods market with Yeezys. Supply/demand: Dunks undersupplied, Yeezys oversupplied.

**Q: Are Foam Runners worth buying?**
A: Only at retail for personal wear. Resale is dead ($90-120 for $80 retail). Don't buy as investment.

## Final Thoughts

The Yeezy vs Dunk resale battle has a clear winner in 2026: Dunks dominate on every metric (appreciation, liquidity, stability, versatility).

Yeezys suffered a historic collapse from oversupply and brand damage. Unless you're buying OG releases under market value or actually want to wear them, avoid Yeezys as investments.

Dunks offer the best risk/reward in sneaker investing: moderate entry prices ($140-1,500), consistent appreciation (25-60% over 5 years), and strong liquidity (sell in 3-5 days).

For sneaker investors, the choice is obvious: Buy Dunks, skip Yeezys.
