# StockX vs GOAT: Which is Better for Sneakers?

*Two platforms dominate the sneaker resale market, but which one deserves your money? We break down StockX vs GOAT across fees, authentication, shipping, and overall experience.*

The sneaker resale market has exploded into a multi-billion dollar industry, and two platforms have emerged as the dominant players: StockX and GOAT. Both offer authentication services, buyer protection, and access to thousands of sought-after sneakers. But which platform is actually better?

The answer, as with most things, is "it depends." Each platform has distinct strengths and weaknesses that matter differently depending on whether you're buying or selling, what you're looking for, and where you're located. This comprehensive comparison will help you make the right choice for your next sneaker purchase or sale.

## Platform Overview

Before diving into specifics, let's understand what each platform offers.

**StockX** launched in 2016 with a stock market-inspired approach to sneaker resale. Their "bid/ask" system lets buyers place bids while sellers set asking prices. When a bid matches an ask, the sale executes automatically. StockX has expanded beyond sneakers into streetwear, electronics, collectibles, and trading cards.

**GOAT** (Greatest Of All Time) launched in 2015 with a focus specifically on sneakers. They offer both new and used sneakers, giving buyers more options at different price points. GOAT merged with Flight Club in 2018, adding consignment retail locations to their online marketplace.

## Fees: The Numbers That Matter

Fees directly impact both buyers and sellers, and they differ significantly between platforms.

### Buyer Fees

**StockX**: Buyers pay a processing fee (around 3%) plus shipping. The processing fee varies by region and has fluctuated over the years. International buyers face additional shipping costs and potential customs fees.

**GOAT**: Buyers see the total price upfront, with shipping included in most cases for domestic US orders. This "what you see is what you pay" approach feels more transparent, though the fees are ultimately built into the displayed price.

**Winner**: GOAT's pricing transparency makes budgeting easier. StockX's fees can surprise buyers at checkout.

### Seller Fees

**StockX**: Sellers pay a transaction fee starting at 10% for new sellers, decreasing to 8% as you complete more sales. There's also a 3% payment processing fee, bringing minimum total fees to around 11-13%.

**GOAT**: Seller fees on GOAT start at 9.5% plus a seller fee that varies by price point (around $5-25 depending on sale price). Commission rates decrease with sales volume.

**Winner**: Close call. Both platforms offer competitive rates that decrease with volume. Calculate based on your specific sale price.

### Fee Comparison Example

For a $300 sneaker sale:

| Platform | Seller Receives (approx.) |
|----------|--------------------------|
| StockX   | ~$260 (13% fees)         |
| GOAT     | ~$257 (9.5% + $15)       |

Results vary based on seller level and specific promotions. Always check current fee structures before listing.

## Authentication: Can You Trust the Process?

Authentication is the core value proposition of both platforms. You're paying premium fees for the assurance that you're getting genuine products.

### StockX Authentication

StockX operates multiple authentication centers worldwide. Every item passes through their facility where trained authenticators examine the product before it ships to the buyer. Their process checks:

- Box condition and labels
- Overall shoe construction
- Materials and stitching
- Colorway accuracy
- Smell and feel (yes, really)

StockX has faced some controversy over authentication failures, with verified fakes occasionally slipping through. They've responded by investing heavily in technology and training, but no system is perfect.

### GOAT Authentication

GOAT's authentication process is similar in scope. All sneakers pass through their authentication centers before reaching buyers. They examine:

- Product authenticity
- Condition matching description
- Box and accessories
- Overall quality

GOAT's acquisition of Flight Club brought additional authentication expertise from the veteran consignment retailer.

### The Used Shoe Advantage

GOAT accepts used sneakers, which StockX does not. This is significant for authentication because:

1. Used sneakers are harder to fake convincingly
2. You can find discontinued models at lower prices
3. Condition is clearly disclosed with photos

**Winner**: Tie on authentication quality, but GOAT wins for offering used options.

## Shipping Speed and Experience

Getting your sneakers quickly matters, especially when you're excited about a new pickup.

### StockX Shipping

StockX's process involves:
1. Seller ships to StockX (2-4 days)
2. Authentication at StockX facility (1-3 days)
3. StockX ships to buyer (2-5 days)

Total typical time: 7-12 business days domestically, longer internationally.

StockX offers expedited shipping options in some markets for additional fees.

### GOAT Shipping

GOAT's process is similar:
1. Seller ships to GOAT (2-4 days)
2. Authentication (1-3 days)
3. GOAT ships to buyer (2-5 days)

Instant Ship items (pre-authenticated inventory at GOAT facilities) arrive faster, typically 3-5 days.

**Winner**: GOAT's Instant Ship option gives it the edge for buyers who want speed.

## User Experience and App Quality

Both platforms live primarily on mobile, and app quality significantly impacts the buying and selling experience.

### StockX App

The StockX app features:
- Clean, stock ticker-inspired interface
- Price history graphs
- Portfolio tracking for your collection
- Bid/ask spread visibility
- Search filters by brand, size, price

The bid system takes some getting used to but becomes intuitive quickly. Price history graphs are excellent for understanding market trends.

### GOAT App

GOAT's app offers:
- More visual, Instagram-style feed
- Used sneaker photos for condition assessment
- Wish list functionality
- Try Before You Buy (in some markets)
- Flight Club store integration

GOAT feels more like shopping, while StockX feels more like trading. Your preference depends on your personality.

**Winner**: Subjective. StockX for data nerds, GOAT for visual shoppers.

## Buyer Protection and Returns

What happens when something goes wrong?

### StockX Policy

StockX's authentication serves as their buyer protection. If a fake slips through, they'll refund you. However, returns for other reasons (changed mind, fit issues) are not accepted. What you buy is what you keep.

### GOAT Policy

GOAT offers more flexibility:
- Returns accepted within 3 days of delivery (for store credit, minus shipping)
- Issues with authentication handled via full refund
- Used item purchases are final

The 3-day return window for credit provides a safety net that StockX doesn't match.

**Winner**: GOAT for buyer flexibility.

## Finding the Best Prices

Here's where deal aggregators like The Hub become valuable. Prices for the same sneaker often differ between platforms—sometimes significantly.

### Price Comparison Tips

1. **Check both platforms**: The same shoe can vary by $20-50 or more
2. **Consider fees**: A lower list price might not mean lower total cost
3. **Watch for promotions**: Both platforms run sales and reduced fee periods
4. **Set price alerts**: Get notified when prices drop

The Hub tracks prices across StockX, GOAT, and other platforms, making comparison shopping simple. Instead of checking multiple apps, you can see all prices in one place and spot the best deals instantly.

### When StockX is Cheaper

StockX tends to have lower prices on:
- Hyped new releases (higher seller volume)
- Popular Jordan retros
- Items during "selling fee" promotions

### When GOAT is Cheaper

GOAT tends to win on:
- Used sneakers (no competition from StockX)
- Older releases with less hype
- Items from Flight Club consignment inventory

## International Buyers: Which is Better?

Location significantly impacts your experience.

### StockX International

StockX operates authentication centers in multiple countries, reducing shipping times and customs complications for many international buyers. However, fees and shipping costs vary significantly by region.

### GOAT International

GOAT's international shipping is available but generally slower than StockX for buyers outside the US. The used sneaker option can offset higher shipping costs with lower base prices.

**Winner**: Depends heavily on your location. Check both for your specific country.

## The Verdict: When to Use Each Platform

**Choose StockX when:**
- You want detailed price history and market data
- You're buying/selling hyped new releases
- You prefer the bid/ask trading system
- You're located near a StockX authentication center

**Choose GOAT when:**
- You want to buy used sneakers
- You prefer upfront pricing without surprise fees
- You might want to return your purchase
- You value the Instant Ship speed option

**Use both (via The Hub) when:**
- You want the absolute best price
- You're flexible on which platform you use
- You're tracking a specific sneaker over time

## Final Thoughts

Both StockX and GOAT have earned their positions as market leaders. Neither is objectively "better"—they serve slightly different needs and preferences. The smartest approach is to check both platforms before any purchase, comparing total costs including fees and shipping.

Aggregator tools like The Hub make this comparison effortless, pulling prices from both platforms so you can make informed decisions without switching between apps. The sneaker market is competitive, and saving $20-30 per pair adds up quickly when you're building a serious collection.
