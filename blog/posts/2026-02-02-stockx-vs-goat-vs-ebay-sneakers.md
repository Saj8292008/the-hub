# StockX vs GOAT vs eBay: Where to Buy Sneakers in 2026

*Three platforms, three different experiences. Here's the real breakdown of fees, authentication, shipping, and which one wins for different situations.*

If you're buying sneakers on the secondary market, you've got three major platforms to choose from: StockX, GOAT, and eBay. Each has evolved significantly over the past few years, and the "best" choice depends entirely on what you're buying and what you prioritize.

We compared dozens of transactions across all three platforms to give you the real talk—not the marketing spin.

## The Quick Comparison

| Factor | StockX | GOAT | eBay |
|--------|--------|------|------|
| Buyer Fees | ~13% | ~10% | ~0% (free shipping listings) |
| Authentication | Yes | Yes | Yes ($150+ sneakers) |
| Shipping Time | 7-14 days | 7-14 days | 3-7 days |
| Price Level | Highest | Middle | Lowest |
| Selection | Good | Best | Good |
| Used Options | No | Yes | Yes |

## StockX: The Stock Market Experience

**Best for:** Deadstock only, quick confidence, market data

StockX pioneered the "stock market for sneakers" concept, and it shows. The bidding interface, price charts, and market data are excellent. Everything is anonymous—you never interact with sellers directly.

**Pros:**
- Clean, easy-to-use interface
- Strong authentication (though not perfect)
- Great historical price data
- Buyer protection is solid

**Cons:**
- **Highest fees** — buyers pay ~13% on top of ask price
- Deadstock only—no used or tried-on options
- Shipping is slow (goes to authentication center first)
- No direct negotiation
- Authentication misses happen (rare but documented)

**The real cost:** That $200 shoe costs you ~$226 after fees and shipping. On a $500 pair, you're paying $65+ in fees.

**When to use StockX:**
- You want deadstock and don't mind paying premium
- You value the streamlined experience
- You want market data for research

## GOAT: The Collector's Choice

**Best for:** Used options, variety, condition grades

GOAT differentiates by offering both new and used sneakers with clear condition grades. Their "Instant" shipping option (pre-authenticated inventory) is a game-changer if you're impatient.

**Pros:**
- Used options with clear condition grades
- "Instant" shipping from their warehouse (3-5 days)
- Slightly lower fees than StockX (~10%)
- Better selection overall
- App experience is excellent

**Cons:**
- Used grading can be inconsistent
- Regular shipping still takes 7-14 days
- Customer service is hit or miss
- Some sellers list same item at different prices

**The grading system:**
- **New** — Deadstock, never worn
- **New with defects** — DS but minor issues (box damage, etc.)
- **Lightly used** — Minimal wear, very good condition
- **Used** — Noticeable wear but no major flaws

**When to use GOAT:**
- You're open to lightly used (significant savings)
- You want variety in pricing options
- You need it faster (use Instant)

## eBay: The Value Play

**Best for:** Deals, local options, established pairs

eBay's Authenticity Guarantee program has transformed it from sketchy marketplace to legitimate competitor. For sneakers over $150, authentication is automatic and free.

**Pros:**
- **Lowest prices** — often 15-20% below StockX/GOAT
- No buyer fees on many listings
- Fastest shipping (direct from seller, auth adds 1-2 days)
- Auction format can score deals
- Established sellers with long histories

**Cons:**
- Interface is dated
- Quality of listings varies
- Authentication is good but not as fast
- Some sellers try to avoid the auth program

**The Authenticity Guarantee:**
For sneakers $150+, eBay routes purchases through their authentication center. Experts verify condition and authenticity before shipping to you. It's free for buyers.

**When to use eBay:**
- Price is your priority
- You're comfortable with the interface
- You want the fastest delivery
- You're buying established releases (not ultra-hyped)

## Real Price Comparison

We tracked the same shoe across all three platforms:

**Jordan 1 Retro High OG "Chicago Lost & Found" (Size 10)**

| Platform | Price | Fees | Total | Ship Time |
|----------|-------|------|-------|-----------|
| StockX | $208 | $27 | $235 | 10 days |
| GOAT | $215 | $22 | $237 | 12 days |
| eBay | $195 | $0 | $195 | 5 days |

**Winner: eBay** — $40 cheaper and faster.

This pattern holds across most mainstream releases. StockX and GOAT compete on experience; eBay wins on price.

## Authentication: Who's Most Reliable?

All three have had authentication misses. The reality:

- **StockX:** 99%+ accuracy, but high-profile misses have hurt reputation
- **GOAT:** Similar accuracy, slightly better reputation currently
- **eBay:** Newer program but backed by professional authenticators

**Our take:** All three are reliable enough for normal purchases. For grails or expensive pairs, consider additional verification (CheckCheck app, trusted reseller opinion).

## Selling: A Different Calculation

The fee structures flip when you're selling:

| Platform | Seller Fees |
|----------|-------------|
| StockX | ~10% |
| GOAT | ~10-15% |
| eBay | ~13% + listing fees |

If you're regularly selling, factor in payout speed too. StockX and GOAT hold funds longer than eBay in many cases.

## The Hybrid Strategy

Smart buyers use all three:

1. **Research on StockX** — best price history and market data
2. **Check GOAT for used** — can save 20-30% on lightly worn
3. **Buy on eBay** — lowest actual prices for most pairs
4. **Set alerts everywhere** — tools like The Hub aggregate across platforms

## Special Situations

**Hyped releases:**
StockX or GOAT. eBay selection is thinner on release day.

**Beaters / daily wear:**
GOAT used or eBay. Why pay DS prices for gym shoes?

**Grails / expensive pairs:**
Any platform, but consider additional authentication.

**Vintage / rare:**
eBay. Better selection of older releases.

## The Bottom Line

There's no single "best" platform—it depends on what you value:

- **Want lowest price?** → eBay
- **Want deadstock reliability?** → StockX
- **Want used options?** → GOAT
- **Want fastest shipping?** → eBay or GOAT Instant
- **Want best data?** → StockX

The smartest play is checking all three before buying. A 5-minute price comparison can save $30-50 on a single pair.
