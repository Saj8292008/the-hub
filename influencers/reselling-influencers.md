## 📧 Sample Outreach (Reselling-Specific)

```
Hey [Name],

Your video on [specific flip/strategy] was sick - that [specific detail like profit margin, sourcing tip, or platform hack] is exactly the kind of stuff I love.

Building The Hub for resellers like us. Think of it as [brief comparison]. Key thing: [mention low fees or specific feature].

Want early access? Would love your honest take on it. If you're into it, we can set up an affiliate code for your audience (thinking [X]% of fees or signups).

No pressure - just trying to get real resellers testing this, not random influencers.
