## 📧 Sample Outreach (Watch-Specific)

```
Hey [Name],

Caught your video on [specific watch] - your point about [specific detail like movement, case finishing, value proposition] was spot on.

Building something called The Hub for the watch community. [Brief description]. Would love to get your take on it - no BS, just curious what someone who actually knows watches thinks.

Happy to give you lifetime access to kick the tires. If you end up digging it, we can talk about ways to work together. If not, no hard feelings.

Either way, keep making great content.
