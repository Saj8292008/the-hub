## 📧 Sample Outreach (Sneaker-Specific)

```
Yo [Name],

That [specific sneaker] review was fire - especially when you talked about [specific detail like comfort, materials, sizing].

Working on something called The Hub for the sneaker community. [Quick description - "think StockX but with lower fees and better community features"].

Would love to hook you up with early access and see what you think. If you're into it, we can talk affiliate deals or collabs. If not, all good - just want real sneakerheads testing it.

Let me know!
