## Maker Comment Template

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Syd], and I built The Hub because I was tired of refreshing 10 different tabs looking for deals on watches.

**The problem:** Great deals on Reddit, StockX, forums, etc. get sniped in minutes. By the time you see them, they're gone.

**The solution:** The Hub monitors all these sources 24/7 and pings you instantly when something matches your criteria.

**What makes it different:**
- 🎯 Deal scoring - not all "deals" are actually deals
- 📊 Price history - see if it's really below market
- ⚡ Instant alerts - Telegram, email, or push
- 🆓 Free tier - no credit card required

We're tracking watches, sneakers, cars, and sports collectibles. More categories coming based on what you want!

Would love your feedback. What would make this more useful for you?
